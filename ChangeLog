    pointer.

Date:   Tue Jul 22 11:51:15 2014 -0700

    Don't return an error string for NO_INTERFACES_FOUND.
    
    Most callers of capture_interface_list() don't expect an error string
    for NO_INTERFACES_FOUND, because that's not really an error, it's just a
    statement of face (and perhaps an error of 0 should be returned), so
    they don't bother freeing the error string, causing a leak.
    
    Instead, have the one place that *did* expect it to return an error
    string just put "No interfaces found" itself.
    
    Also, have that place not check for an error string if interfaces *were*
    found, as no error code or string is returned in that case.

    Don't put hyphens in the rc's versions.
    
    Apparently neither RPM nor the Debian packaging systems like having hyphens in
    in the version.
    
    This change leaves a hyphen in the daily builds (which means we can't build

    Only one buffer.c, please.
    
    Otherwise, if you link with both libwiretap and libfiletap, it's
    anybody's guess which one you get.  That means you're wasting memory
    with two copies of its routines if they're identical, and means
    surprising behavior if they're not (which showed up when I was debugging
    a double-free crash - fixing libwiretap's buffer_free() didn't fix the
    problem, because Wireshark happened to be calling libfiletap' unfixed
    buffer_free()).
    
    There's nothing *tap-specific about Buffers, anyway, so it really
    belongs in wsutil.

    ssl-utils. While at it, skip dissection when the tree is NULL, remove
    the plural from certificates length (the length is always larger than
    ome), fix type of "ti" for dtls, get rid of "failsafe" subtree
    assignment in ssl, get rid of tvb_ensure_bytes_exist in ssl.

    HTTP2: Backport to 1.12
    * Add HPACK decompression (add lib nghttp2)
    * Update to draft-13
    
    HTTP2: Showing decompressed headers
    
    Decode the HTTP/2 header block using nghttp2 HPACK decoder
    
    In this patch, We use nghttp2 HPACK decoder to decompress HTTP/2 header
    block.  To make HPACK decompressor work, we need to track down HTTP/2
    connection from the beginning.  If we see the HTTP/2 magic (connection
    preface), we initialize HPACK decompressor objects.  We actually use 2
    HPACK decompressor for both client and server.  HPACK decompressor
    objects are stored in hash tables using TCP stream index as a key.

    pre-commit: Add 'unset GREP_OPTIONS' (similar to Gerrit commit-msg)
    
      msysgit grep is fairly old and doesn't recognize certain
      grep options, e.g., '--color=auto'.
    
      I imagine there may possibly be other grep option issues
      on various platforms.
    
      (I also note that the various git scripts in libexec/git-core
       clear out GREP_OPTIONS before calling grep).

    udvm: free the buffer *before* throwing the exception
    
    Freeing it after the exception doesn't do much, for obvious reasons. Also move
    the allocation a bit later, and add modelines.
    
    This fixes one major memory leak, although on inspection this code still isn't
    safe since there are exception-throwing functions called all over the place with
    glib memory active. Outside the scope of this fix though.

    Add printf-format annotations, fix garbage
    
    The WRETH dissector showed up some garbage in the column display. Upon
    further inspection, it turns out that the format string had a trailing
    percent sign which caused (unsigned)-1 to be returned by
    g_printf_string_upper_bound (in emem_strdup_vprintf). Then ep_alloc is
    called with (unsigned)-1 + 1 = 0 memory, no wonder that garbage shows
    up. ASAN could not even catch this error because EP is in charge of
    this.
    
    So, start adding G_GNUC_PRINTF annotations in each header that uses
    the "fmt" or "format" paramters (grepped + awk). This revealed some
    other errors. The NCP2222 dissector was missing a format string (not
    a security vuln though).
    
    Many dissectors used val_to_str with a constant (but empty) string,
    these have been replaced by val_to_str_const. ASN.1 dissectors
    were regenerated for this.
    
    Minor: the mate plugin used "%X" instead of "%p" for a pointer type.
    
    The ncp2222 dissector and wimax plugin gained modelines.

    ssl: fix ClientKeyExchange, fix TLSv1.2 SKE for DH
    
    Since DTLS and TLS do not differ in handling ClientKeyExchange and
    ServerKeyExchange, its dissection got moved to ssl-utils. The code is
    based on the SSL dissector, with header field names adjusted to the
    DTLS ones (those got capitalized). Besides a version difference (for
    signatures), the header field and function names, the DTLS and SSL code
    are equal (this is verified).
    
    This patch refactors the dissectors for DHE_RSA and ECDHE to make use of
    a common function to dissect the signed_params field. All offset
    tracking is also removed in favor of exception handling by the
    proto_tree_add_item function. Occurrences of proto_tree_add_uint are
    also replaced by proto_tree_add_item for simplicity.
    
    After those changes, the SKE dissector for DH key exchanges is updated
    to handle the mandatory signature field in TLSv1.2, using the newly
    added function. (bug 9208)
    
    Another bug occurred after the length check removal, pre-TLS and
    OpenSSL's old DTLS implemenation do not include a vector length in
    the CKE. This is now also fixed. (bug 10222)
    
    Other minor changes: comments added/corrected, renamed
    keyex_dh -> keyex_dhe (includes DHE_RSA and DHE_DSS).

Date:   Thu Jun 19 21:35:46 2014 -0400

    packet-vnc.c: Improve re-assembly.
    
    Essentially:
    
      When more data is needed to continue dissecting a PDU, use
      DESEGMENT_ONE_MORE_SEGMENT instead of repeatedly requesting
      additional bytes (for one or a few more fields).
    
      - Improves the efficiency of the dissection;
    
      - Prevents 'one-pass' tshark dissection from redissecting
        the PDU repeatedly many, many times with each time dissecting
        the PDU with one or a few more additional fields.
        This generated *lots* of (repeated) output since a reassembled
        VNC PDU can contain many fields (each of short length).
    
      - (A comment in packet-tcp.c states, in effect, that repeatedly
         requesting a specific amount of more bytes to dissect a PDU
         will "break reassembly" although I note that the reassembly did
         seem to work (in-efficiently)).
    
    Note: Although this patch improves the handling of reassembly, the
          dissector has significant issues. For example. see Bug #5366.
    
    I expect this fixes the Bug #10134 issue: "Cannot allocate memory";
    
    Before the fix, 'tshark -nVxr' for the input file generated trees with
    multiple hundreds of thousands of entries and generated reassembled
    PDUs consisting of many, many small fragments.

    The catapult dissector tripped on this random file I had. A quick look
    at other dissectors which use a construct like "-1] *= '*\\[rn]" showed
    packet-irda too, so fix that as well.

    Fail if any of the install-exec-hook commands fails.
    
    Hopefully, this will mean that somebody doing a set-UID/set-GID/setcap
    installation as themselves rather than as root will not "succeed" but
    leave dumpcap installed without enhanced privileges, so the underlying
    problem in bugs such as bug 10247 will be more obvious.

    size is 65549; they went to the next power of 2 up.

    This fix does change the format printed for values using bitmasks

    EPL: Reassemble the splitted payload
    
      The data that is sent when downloading or uploading from a server is
      sent in segments to the client.To clearly display all the segments
      belonging together the splitted payload needs to be reassembled.
    
      The behaviour is described in the powerlink specification 301 v1.2.0
      chapter 6.3.2.4.1.1 Download Protocol and chapter 6.3.2.4.2 Upload
      Protocol. The payload of the download/upload is now reassembled.
    
      Backport - This is an enhancement over the current dissector in a way,   that the former segmented payload can be debugged better.

    When building an OS X package for GTK+, put the libraries in lib.
    
    This reverts to the way we did it prior to the switch to Qt; with GTK+,
    Contents/MacOS/Wireshark is just a launcher, and the Wireshark binary is
    in Contents/Resources/bin/wireshark-bin, and the appropriate rpath entry
    would be @executable_path/../lib - @executable_path/../Frameworks, which
    works for the Qt version, in which Contents/MacOS/Wireshark is the
    actual executable, doesn't work for the GTK+ version.
    
    This should fix bug 10185.

     - refs to true_false_strings should use TFS(&...) macro.
       also: true_false_string definitions should not be defined as arrays.
     - remove some unneeded #includes (packet-ipmi.c).
     - Do some re-indentation.

    This fix now allows SASL/GSS-API with integrity only to be properly dissected
    in that we now properly indicate the checksum and provide the wrapped token to
    the LDAP dissector to dissect.
    
    There is still a problem in that the wrong parts of the SASL packet can be
    indicated when users click on some parts.
    
    I am committing it for review and because it is much better than the current
    code.

    Sync .deb packaging from Debian
    
    The sync makes CMake the build system for the .deb package
    and starts providing wireshark-qt in the wireshark-qt package.
    The package structure, i.e. the libraries are shipped in separate
    packages is also sync-ed.
    
    Wireshark-qt uses the Qt 4 libraries, but it is easy to switch
    it to Qt 5.

    EIGRP Sequence TLV Dissector Patch
    
    In the EIGRP packet dissector, the dissector routine for the Sequence TLV
    dissected the TLV only up to the first address in the list. However, the
    Sequence TLV contains a variably sized list of addresses. This patch
    modifies the routine so that it processes the entire TLV, not just the
    first address in the contained list.
    
    Also, in the dissect_eigrp(), replaced calls to tvb_new_subset() with
    the reported length set to -1 with the call to tvb_new_subset_length().
    TLVs always carry information about their length. And this time,
    correct truly ALL calls in the switch{} section.
    
    Sample packet capture is available in BugZilla.

    Introduce 802.11 dissectors with wired-in "FCS present" indications.
    
    For a number of protocols that encapsulate 802.11 frames inside packets,
    whether the frame includes an FCS or not is specified by the protocol,
    not by whether the link-layer frame carrying the packets *itself*
    includes an FCS.  As we've done with Ethernet, add "_withfcs" and
    "_withoutfcs" dissectors, which *don't* check the pseudo-header FCS
    length indication, and call those, rather than dissectors that check the
    pseudo-header length indication, from the dissectors for those protocols.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sat May 24 17:04:44 2014 -0700

    Add support for dissecting non-packet records.
    
    Add a dissector table indexed by the file type, and, for the
    file-type-specific records, have the frame dissector skip the usual
    pseudo-header processing, as the pseudo-header has a file-type-specific
    record subtype in it, and call the dissector for that file type's
    records.

    Fixed mausb valid bit & added invalid_valid TFS
    
    Fixed valid bit check for MAUSB EPHandleResp packet. the valid bit
    is active low (ie: valid = 0, invalid = 1).
    
    I noticed Some other dissectors also defined an tfs_invalid_valid,
    so got rid of their local definitions & added it to epan/tfs.c.

Date:   Sat May 24 14:53:15 2014 -0700

    Distinguish between "events" and "reports".
    
    Have two different classes of file-type-specific records - "events" and
    "reports".  An "event" indicates something that happened in the capture
    process, such as a status transition on the network; a "report" just
    gives information not corresponding to something happening in the
    capture process, such as capture statistics.
    
    Note that both of those should be dissected and displayed like packets,
    and leave open the possibility of file-type-specific records whose
    contents should be processed and saved but not displayed in the packet
    list.
    
    Shorten "file_type_specific" to "ft_specific".

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sat May 24 13:57:11 2014 -0700

    Add support for plugins to handle pcap-ng block types.
    
    We rename "file format" plugins to "libwiretap" plugins, as they can
    register as read handlers for a new file type, read/write handlers for a
    pcap-ng block type (or both).
    
    To register as a pcap-ng block type handler, in the
    register_wtap_module() routine of your plugin, call
    register_pcapng_block_type_handler() with the pcap-ng block type and
    pointers to your routines to read and write those blocks.  Those
    routines should read and write REC_TYPE_FILE_TYPE_SPECIFIC records, with
    the block type in the pseudo-header for the record in the struct
    wtap_pkthdr structure, with time stamps stored in that structure, and
    with a blob of data for the rest of the record.
    
    This is for bug 8590.

commit 2310c43

    Allow wtap_read() and wtap_seek_read() to return records other than packets.
    
    Add a "record type" field to "struct wtap_pkthdr"; currently, it can be
    REC_TYPE_PACKET, for a record containing a packet, or
    REC_TYPE_FILE_TYPE_SPECIFIC, for records containing file-type-specific
    data.
    
    Modify code that reads packets to be able to handle non-packet records,
    even if that just means ignoring them.
    
    Rename some routines to indicate that they handle more than just
    packets.
    
    We don't yet have any libwiretap code that supplies records other than
    REC_TYPE_PACKET or that supporting writing records other than
    REC_TYPE_PACKET, or any code to support plugins for handling
    REC_TYPE_FILE_TYPE_SPECIFIC records; this is just the first step for bug
    8590.

    use "the count of packets we've read is 1" as an indication that we've

    Zero out pinfo->src and dst before adding a frag.
    
    If an mp2t packet contains one full subpacket and the fragment of
    another one, it happens that the first subpacket will set src or dst to
    an ethernet or IP address. Adding the fragment of the second subpacket
    will then use this information for calculating the hash in the fragment
    table. However, later fragments in other mp2t packets will not have
    these info and reassembly will fail.

Date:   Thu May 22 20:01:31 2014 -0700

    Allow wtap_read() and wtap_seek_read() to return non-packet records.
    
    This is the first step towards implementing the mechanisms requestd in
    bug 8590; currently, we don't return any records other than packet
    records from libwiretap, and just ignore non-packet records in the rest
    of Wireshark, but this at least gets the ball rolling.

Date:   Thu May 22 14:53:30 2014 -0700

    Don't use sizeof(guintN) for sizes of data in packets.
    
    Either
    
    	1) sizeof(guintN) = N/8, in which case it's redundant
    
    or
    
    	2) sizeof(guintN) != N/8, in which case it's wrong.
    
    This also keeps us from having to throw casts at complaints about
    shortening 64-bit values.

    wiretap: remove unused code, drop number_of_interfaces
    
    While investigating an ASAN issue (fixed in
    commit dcdd076ab0965c346efe90051678ba790eaf7a02), I got greatly confused
    by three different types having the same "interface_data" field name:
    
     * pcapng_t *pn stores an array of interface_data_t objects.
     * wtap *wth stores an array of wtapng_if_descr_t objects.
     * pcapng_dump_t should store an array of interface_data_t objects.
    
    pcapng_dump_t and friends are unused since
    commit c7f1a431d23e17a15777652b1252e139f182b0e6, so drop it.
    
    To fix the confusion, rename the interface_data_t type to
    interface_info_t type and use the local variable "iface_info"
    everywhere. Rename interface_data of pcapng_t to "interfaces" and
    add a comment what this exactly means (interfaces listed in the capture
    file).
    
    Drop the number_of_interfaces field for interfaces as the array
    length is already available from GArray. Now interface_data is always
    initialized for wth (which also gets copied to idb).
    
    s/int/guint/g and replace cast at some places.
    
    There are no regressions for the in-tree test suite.

    Fixes after wmem_strdup_vprintf() optimization
    
    - g_vsnprintf()[1] buffer size can includes space for terminating NUL,
      this simplifies code, and fix problems with string truncation
    
    - g_vsnprintf() returns number of bytes without terminating NUL, so we
      need to do + 1
    
    - second g_vsnprintf() call use already consumed 'ap2' va_arg, which
      makes wmem_strdup_vprintf() doesn't work/ crash for FORMATTED string length > 80

    IP Protocol : Update description of IP Protocol
    
    From Boaz
    
    In IANA the two IPv4 protocols are defined:
    
    35	IDPR	Inter-Domain Policy Routing Protocol
    45	IDRP	Inter-Domain Routing Protocol
    http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml
    
    However, in Wireshark, they are named:
    
    { IP_PROTO_IDPR,    "Interdomain routing" },    /* 35 IDPR Inter-Domain Policy Routing Protocol [Martha_Steenstrup] */
    { IP_PROTO_IDRP,    "IDRP" },                   /* 45 IDRP Inter-Domain Routing Protocol [Sue_Hares] */
    
    Which is somewhat confusing.
    
    I think IDPR should be named "Inter-Domain Policy Routing".
    And IDRP should be named "Inter-Domain Routing Protocol".

    Make (almost) all fields filterable and use "normal" dissection functions to do it.
    
    Removed the additional "parseFields" layer as it was unnecessary and IMO ends up creating more work for a developer if they want to add additional filterable fields.  That layer also hid the (large) number of unfilterable fields that were in the dissector that would normally be caught by counting the number of proto_tree_add_text function calls.

    Use wmem_array_append rather than wmem_array_append_one to make sure the pointer
    types match up. _append_one automatically takes the address of its argument,
    which causes problems if that argument is already a pointer.
    
    Thanks to Alexis for catching this.

    tcp: display calculated checksum
    
    While debugging a network issue, I found incorrect TCP checksums. These
    are shown in the packet details, but are not available as column. This
    patch adds the "tcp.checksum_calculated" field which is only available
    if a checksum can be calculated (i.e., checksumming is enabled and the
    full segment is available).
    
    The fields are added separately for each checksum case to make it appear
    before "Checksum Bad/Good" and to avoid calculating the expected field
    value for the "good" cases.

    Dumber "simple" wmem allocator.
    
    Instead of maintaining a hash table, just alloc a really big array of pointers.
    This is theoretically bad since it means frees and reallocs become O(n), but in
    practice it makes the capture from bug 10098 run about 20% faster under
    valgrind. This makes sense, since the workload is heavily dominated by
    allocations, and most frees/reallocs are recently allocated (so they will be
    found quickly at the beginning of the scan).

    Condense DIS dissector to a single file.
    
    This doesn't appears to be "autogenerated", and it certainly isn't the biggest dissector even after the merge.  This avoid file pollution, makes less non-static variables/functions and makes the check* scripts job easier.

    Minor optimization to packet-frame.c
    
    When printing the protocol list item (which happens for every packet when using
    tshark -T) the resulting string is almost guaranteed to be longer than the
    default 16 characters. By allocating a bigger buffer right away we avoid some
    potentially-expensive reallocs as the string grows.

    The "architectural" changes can be found in cfile.h, wtap.h, wtap-int.h and (new file) wftap-int.h. Most of the other (painstaking) changes were really just the result of compiling those new architecture changes.

    Use a strong hash function for ethernet addresses.
    
    The capture for bug 10078 caused the buildbot to time out; callgrind revealed an
    enourmous amount of time being spent looking up ethernet addresses. The previous
    code cast each address (6 bytes) to a guint64 (8 bytes) then used the built-in
    g_int64_hash. Unfortunately, g_int64_hash is an *awful* hash function - it
    produces a 4-byte hash by simply discarding the upper 4 bytes of its input.
    
    For the capture file in question this strategy (which effectively ignores the
    upper two bytes of each ethernet address) produced an astounding number of
    collisions, leading to the terrible running-time.
    
    Use wmem_strong_hash directly on the 6-byte address instead, which saves us a
    bunch of useless casting and bit-twiddling and produces a much better hash
    distribution. This shaves 20% off the time to tshark-with-tree the capture file
    in question *despite* a substantially more expensive hash function
    (wmem_strong_hash is not exactly fast compared to g_int64_hash).

    Increase the work used to time wmem allocators
    
    It appears that on some platforms the timer underlying g_test_timer() is

    doing was not enough for the timer to provide a useful value.
    
    Bumping the amount of work should provide more meaningful values, and the whole

    Several tweaks to fast block allocator
    
    - manually inline wmem_block_fast_add_to_block_list, it was only two lines and
      only called twice, so the function boilerplate was outweighing the abstraction
    
    - change free_all to release all but one block to the OS immediately, making gc
      a no-op; the alloc logic doesn't reuse later blocks anyways, so this was
      effectively a leak

commit f181756
Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri May 2 09:53:33 2014 -0400

    Optimize wmem_strbuf_grow.
    
    As suggested by Anders, in the case of repeated calls to wmem_strbuf_append_c
    (and other functions which append very little data) the growth check was a
    substantial portion of the over-all running time. By short-circuiting the check
    in the case where growth isn't needed (as opposed to letting it fall-through
    naturally) we shave ~25% off the cost of such repeated calls in my benchmarks.
    
    The function (wmem_strbuf_grow) is inline, so the compiler should be able to
    optimize each caller individually for the short-circuit.

    Now the user will be informed about which packages were not found
    and an error will be raised, as packages sought are the ones that
    are selected for the build.
    
    This change also ads fixes to some improper PACKAGE_VAR

    Add an API for programmatically adding ESP SAs (most likely from a private
    dissector).
    
    Also, speed up ESP decryption in several ways:
    - store gcrypt_cipher_hd in the SA struct, rather than continually
    open, setkey and close for each PDU
    - don't convert the key string from ascii to hex each time - do it upon
    during update callback and keep
    - do the decryption in-place, avoiding the need to allocate, memcpy and
    free a separate buffer for encrypted data
    - when matching addresses, avoid doing a strlen until after we check
    whether or not we're matching against "*"

    prefs: prevent double-free on changing prefs
    
    Prevent double-free when changing profiles. After switching from the
    default profile to a profile without a preferences file,
    saved_at_version will be freed, but a new version will not be inserted
    (because the prefs file is empty). On a subsequent switch to another
    profile, the saved_at_version field is freed again leading to a crash.

    prefs: fix ASAN error due to invalid indirection
    
    For pref_current, indirection of pref->varp.string will cause a read of
    size 8. This will cause a global buffer overflow error for all smaller
    types, for example lbmc_use_heuristic_subdissectors (size 4).
    
    Reproduce: compile Wireshark with -fsanitize=address, open Preferences
    and select OK or Apply. Result: ASAN crash.
    
    To fix this, only indirect a pointer if the storage size is known, a
    void pointer stores the address of the constant value (pref_default,
    pref_stashed) or the address to the value (pref_current). Note that
    pointers of different types are of equal size, I could take
    valp.pref_(anything).
    
    While at it, remove superfluous 'break' keywords where a 'return'
    keyword is present.

Author: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
Date:   Sun Apr 27 10:39:23 2014 +0200

    http: Fix src/dest mapping for proxied connections
    
    Using value_is_in_range is making quite some assumptions, namely (1) the
    proxy server is always run on a registered HTTP port, and (2) the
    source (client) port is always not HTTP. The former is quite a strong
    assertion which fails to hold when using a custom port (8008) that got
    detected through heuristics.
    
    Fix this by recording the source address and port pair for the server
    and then check this against the current packet.
    
    This fixes detection of a SSL conversation where two conversations got
    detected instead of one. Example: 8008 is proxy, 443 is target server.
    Now the proxied conversation got detected as 443 --> "client port"
    (server to client, ok) and 443 --> 8008 (client to server, not ok,
    should be "client port" --> 443).

    http: Display a list of cookies
    
    For long cookies, the label "[truncated] Cookie: foo=v..." is not really
    helpful. Add a new subtree to display individual cookies, this makes
    copying values much easier.
    
    A new "http.cookie_pair" field was added instead of re-using
    "http.cookie". This has the advantage that `tshark -Tfields -e
    http.cookie` does not end up with duplicates. At the same time, one can
    match against individual cookie values.
    
    I also considered to limit the number of cookies to be split, but as
    there is no limit on the number of headers, I decided not to be
    restrictive for cookies either.

    - Use ...add_text() instead of ..._add_string() for a packet details "header" line

    Don't throw for offset at end of TVB with len -1.
    
    g867a1827e7dc88896ee27a107eb35c4b3973d270 introduced a change to cleanup/fix
    handling of bounds checks for -1 length fields, but it ended up guaranteeing a

    Hash map implementation for wmem.
    
    This has two expected uses:
    - Many current users of wmem_tree don't actually need the predecessor lookup
      it provides (the lookup_le function family). A hash map provides straight
      insertion and lookup much more efficiently than a wmem_tree when predecessor
      lookup isn't needed.
    
    - Many current users of glib's hash table and hash functions use untrusted data
      for keys, making them vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks. Care has
      been taken to make this implementation secure against such attacks, so it
      should be used whenever data is untrusted.
    
    In my benchmarks it is measurably slower than GHashTable, but not excessively
    so. Given the additional security it provides this seems like a reasonable
    trade-off (and it is still faster than a wmem_tree).

    CaptureDialog: Fix IF type for user created pipe
    
     - If a user adds a pipe via "Capture Options"->"Manage Interfaces"
       ->"Pipes" the device.if_type.type is either not filled out (in
       the case if no other interfaces exist), or will be set to the
       last set if_type of the device queried by the iteration in line
       3537.
    
     - One could argue, that this is just a fixup, as still the issue
       remains, that the device structure will not be resetted, after
       the search for an already existing pipe element. Maybe a separate
       variable should be used for searching as it is used for adding
       the pipe

    Bugfix generating a sequence of "native" types.  Bug 9532.
    
    Previously a sequence of "native" types (int, float, etc) generated a proto_tree_add_uint (for the loop over the sequence) and a proto_tree_add_XXX (for the "native" type), but only 1 hf variable was created for the "loop" field, so DISSECTOR_ASSERT_NOT_REACHED would be generated if "native" type != uint.  Now a separate hf_ variable is generated for the "loop" and "native" type.
    
    Also update existing IDL dissectors with new generator logic.

    Fix ASAN error due to invalid type
    
    ei_array is supposed to be an array of expert_entry items. However, it
    was initialized of an array of expert_info_t items which is much larger.
    This caused an ASAN error when running `tshark -z expert` because
    expert_stat_packet wants to read past the stack.
    
    Fix this by correcting the type. While at it, reduce the size of
    expert_entry for 64-bit systems (reduces initial memory usage by 8
    kilobytes) and avoid a redundant g_array_index call.

    Modern hosts typically open many more TCP and UDP connections than in

    can easily trigger dozens of separate connections. At the same time our
    services file has accumulated a lot of cruft over time. As a result
    transport name resolution is a bunch of lies.

commit d47ae54
Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Apr 20 17:27:18 2014 -0400

    Replace linked list of proto fields with array
    
    This is substantially more memory-efficient, shaving another ~1.5MB off our base
    usage. It also lets us remove the annoying extra "last_field" pointer and
    simplify proto_register_field_common(). It also accidentally fixed what may
    have been a memory leak in proto_unregister_field().
    
    It unfortunately complicates proto_get_next_protocol_field() to require
    refetching the protocol each time, but that is itself just an array-lookup under
    the covers (and isn't much used), so I don't expect the performance hit to be
    noticable.

    Don't distinguish between "GCC" and "Clang" extra -W flags.
    
    We test whether a given compiler supports a given -W flag, so we don't
    need to separate them and check them only for particular compilers.
    
    To make that even clearer, rename the --enable option from
    --enable-extra-gcc-checks to --enable-extra-compiler-checks, and
    document it as just "do additional -W checks", and rename the
    WIRESHARK_EXTRA_GCC_ CMake variables to WIRESHARK_EXTRA_COMPILER_.
    
    Sync up the lists of warning flags in CMake with the lists in autoconf.
    
    Uncomment -Wdocumentation while we're at it.  If it doesn't work *at
    all*, comment it out until it's fixed, or, better yet, fix it; if it
    still produces warnings, we just leave it among the "extra" flags.

    Try to fix bug 10000.
    
    This involves duplicating macros, but at least it
    
    	1) doesn't have empty arguments to macros, which are apparently
    	   considered "undefined" by C90 and C++98
    
    and
    
    	2) doesn't involve "extern" applied to a definition rather than
    	   a declaration, which breaks building on some platforms (and
    	   which I think is also not legal C).

    Add tvb_get and proto_tree_add for string-encoded byte arrays
    
    This commit adds tvb_get_string_bytes and proto_tree_add_bytes_item routines for
    getting GByteArrays fields from the tvb when they are encoded in ASCII hex string form.
    
    The proto_tree_add_bytes_item routine is also usable for normal
    binary encoded byte arrays, and has the advantage of retrieving
    the array values even if there's no proto tree.
    
    It also exposes the routines to Lua, both so that a Lua script can take
    advantage of this, but also so I can write a testsuite to test the functions.

    ssl: Detect unencrypted heartbeat messages
    
    Records are always unencrypted before the ChangeCipherSpec message. This
    patch assumes that conversations without a SSL decoder (i.e. before
    calling ssl_change_cipher) are unencrypted. If it turns out that the
    contents were encrypted anyway, then there is about 0.8% probability
    that the heartbeat message gets recognized wrong
    (dissect_ssl3_heartbeat checks if the first byte equals 1 (request) or 2
    (response)). Not a big deal, and the advantage that the heartbleed
    expert information is triggered overweights that possible mistake.
    
    (Note that ssl_set_master_secret as called by external code will also
    invoke ssl_change_cipher, but that should be caught by the if
    condition in the line before this hunk.)
    
    An example capture is available at:

    Squelch some warnings:
    
    The dictionary_id member of a spdy_conv_t is only used if we have libz;
    put it inside the #ifdef.  That also lets us give it a type of uLong,
    from libz, which avoids it being 32 bits when the type returned by
    adler32() is 64 bits.  (The *value returned by adler32()* might always
    fit in 32 bits, but this is arguably cleaner than throwing a cast at the
    problem.)
    
    The third argument to adler32() is a uInt; cast sizeof to uInt to avoid
    other 32-bit-vs-64-bit warnings.  (It should have been size_t, but maybe
    libz antedated size_t's availability in all the compilers that were used
    to compile it.)
    
    The buffer size in spdy_decompress_header_block() is always 16K; just
    make it a #define that is *not* size_t, so that we avoid other
    32-bit-vs-64-bit warnings.
    
    Use DISSECTOR_ASSERT_NOT_REACHED() for "this can't happen" - it's marked
    as "doesn't return", so we don't get "variable is unassigned" warnings
    (at least not from the Clang I'm using), and also means we wouldn't get
    a crash if it *does* happen (we just get a warning on the console and in
    the protocol tree).

commit e80f9cd
Author: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
Date:   Sun Apr 13 23:35:29 2014 +0200

    Fix crash on invalid SSH_CONNECTION and SSH_CLIENT values
    
    The third parameter to g_strsplit is the maximum number of elements, you
    cannot just assume that a vector with exactly that number of elements
    is available. This will crash for example: `SSH_CONNECTION= wireshark`.
    
    This patch takes care of that and also fixes a memleak due to missing
    g_strfreev. To reduce code bloat, return the filter at last so that
    g_strfreev does not have to be repeated before returning.
    
    Note that it still possible for the filter to contain absolute junk
    since the port and host number is not validated...

    Call each item in the Extended IS Reachability CLV an "IS Neighbor".
    
    This makes it a bit more like the (un-extended) Reachability CLVs.
    
    Also, just make the top-level items just a text field, just like the
    top-level items for neighbors in the (un-extended) Reachability CLVs.
    
    Rename the system IDs to be "... neighbor ID", not just "neighbor"; the
    top-level items hold all the information for the neighbor, and the
    system ID for the neighbor is just one of those pieces of information.

    Add tvb_get and proto_tree_add for string-encoded timestamps
    
    This commit adds tvb_get_string_time and proto_tree_add_time_item routines for
    getting nstime fields from the tvb when they are encoded in ASCII string form.
    
    The proto_tree_add_time_item routine is also usable for normal
    big/little-endian encoded time_t, and has the advantage of retrieving
    the value even if there's no proto tree.
    
    It also exposes the routines to Lua, both so that a Lua script can take
    advantage of this, but also so I can write a testsuite to test the functions.

    Fix Bug 9951: 'git commit hook isn't calling checkAPIs.pl with arguments for the dissectors'
    
    I recently made a change to packet-rtp.c and inappropriately included
    g_error() in it, which the builbots caught during their run of checkAPIs.pl.
    But checkAPIs.pl is supposed to catch such things for us before we submit, by
    being invoked in the git pre-commit hook.
    
    Apparently though, buildbots call checkAPIs.pl with extra arguments for
    different cases... and for packet dissectors it calls it with a '-g abort'
    argument, which is how it caught the g_error.
    
    So the "bug" is that the pre-commit hook should invoke checAPIs.pl with that
    argument too, for epan/dissectors/packet-*.c files.

    Get rid of more tvb_get_nstringz* calls.
    
    Add an FT_STRINGZPAD type, for null-padded strings (typically
    fixed-length fields, where the string can be up to the length of the
    field, and is null-padded if it's shorter than that), and use it.  Use
    IS_FT_STRING() in more cases, so that less code needs to know what types
    are string types.
    
    Add a tvb_get_stringzpad() routine, which gets null-padded strings.
    Currently, it does the same thing that tvb_get_string_enc() does, but
    that might change if we don't store string values as null-terminated
    strings.

    - the GUI is quite ugly
    - features like background color in filter box does not work
    - x64 builds are still using GTK2
    - no one is putting efforts on this to fix those issues
    
    As we are transitioning to Qt, I do not expect any improvement soon.
    Let's switch back to a more user friendly GUI.

    Clean up the dissection of ServiceContexts.
    
    Make the top-level item for a ServiceContext an item for the
    ServiceContext as a while, and put the VSCID under it like other items,
    rather than making the VSCID the top-level item.
    
    Don't dissect the VSCID using the value_string field for the Object
    Management Group's SCIDs; use that value_string field for the SCID if
    the VSCID is 0 (meaning "Object Management Group"), and have no
    value_string field for the VSCID otherwise (the interpretation of the
    SCID depends on the value of the VSCID).
    
    Dissect the encapsulation information even for unknown ServiceContexts.
    
    If the ServiceContext's length is bigger than what it's supposed to be,
    throw an exception if it's also bigger than the data available in the
    packet; this squelches a run-time warning in that case.

    FALSE instead using unset command. This ensures that
    no if(WERROR) or if(WERR_UNKNOWN) clause will trigger
    unless these variables are set to another value.

    Don't assume the data pointed to by an address structure is aligned.
    
    And don't assume you can dereference the pointer nonetheless; that
    doesn't work on SPARC, for example - you get an unaligned-access trap.
    
    Instead, use pntoh32() to fetch IPv4 address values from the address
    structures.
    
    While we're at it, just use guint32 for those addresses; we don't need
    in_addr_t.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Apr 7 15:39:55 2014 -0700

    Handle string types with somewhat appropriate encodings.
    
    For various string types defined in X.680, use the appropriate encoding,
    or ENC_ASCII|ENC_NA in some cases where we don't have an appropriate
    encoding yet.
    
    This most significantly fixes the handling of BMPString and
    UniversalString, which are supersets of ASCII (Unicode Basic
    Multilingual Plane and Unicode, respectively), but don't encode ASCII
    characters as single octets.  It also fixes UTF8String to, well,
    properly recognize UTF-8.
    
    This also lets us get rid of the special handling of SyntaxBMPString in
    X.509sat (and, in fact, *requires* us to get rid of it, as, otherwise,
    the string value appears twice).

    Add a Qt I/O Graph dialog.
    
    For each graph you can set:
    - Its visibility
    - A name
    - A display filter
    - Color, from a fixed list
    - Plot style: Line, Impulse, Bar, Stacked Bar, Dot, Square, Diamond
    - Basic Y Axes (packets/s, bytes/s, bits/s)
    - Computed Y Axes (SUM, MIN, AVG, MAX)
    - Smoothing
    
    You can pan and zoom using the mouse and keyboard. Clicking on a graph
    selects the last packet for that interval. If all graphs have the same Y
    axis a single label is shown, otherwise a legend is shown.
    
    The time scale (X axis) can be toggled between relative seconds and the
    time of day.
    
    Graphs can be saved as PDF, PNG, BMP, and JPEG. Settings are "sticky"
    via the io_graphs UAT.
    
    To do:
    - Minimize graph drawing delays.
    - Figure out why smoothing differs from GTK+
    - Everything else at the top of io_graph_dialog.cpp
    - Fix empty resets.
    
    A fair amount of code was copied from TCPStreamDialog. We might want to
    subclass QCustomPlot and place the shared code there.
    
    Move common syntax checking to SyntaxLineEdit.
    
    Move some common code from ui/gtk/io_stat.c to ui/io_graph_item.[ch] and

    Fix Bug 9958: 'SDP displays double spaces between payload formats as a 0 payload format'
    
    Given an SDP m= line such as this:
    
        m=audio 29156 RTP/AVP 18  0
    
    SDP will show a media format of G.729 (the 18) and then two G.711 entries: one
    for the extra space between the 18 and 0, and one format for the 0. The latter
    is correct, but the extra space one isn't.
    
    Technically such an m= line is malformed, since only one space is allowed
    between payload formats; but it's definitely not a format of 0.
    
    A similar thing happens in many parts of SDP dissection code. It needs to issue
    an expert error and handle it gracefully.

    Move the status dissecting code to the AFP dissector.
    
    The ASP and DSI dissectors had almost-identical dissection of the ASP
    and DSI "status" responses. What's being dissected is defined by the AFP
    specification (and might be different for protocols *other* than AFP
    running atop AFP or DSI), so move that dissection to the AFP dissector.
    
    Note that, at least for AFP-over-DSI, the spec isn't being followed in
    at least one capture.

    Get it compiling again: WindowsXP build failing
    
    The WindowsXP build is failing due to a wslua testsuite failure, in the
    file reader/writer tests. I've looked at it a bit and I don't know
    why it's failing yet - I know why it says it's failing, but it doesn't
    fail for me. And it was passing on WindowsXP until the change to Lua 5.2.3,
    but I run 5.2.3 all the time and it passes for me, and there's nothing
    special about the portion that's failing.
    
    The only way to debug it is to run it on WindowsXP myself, but I need
    a build to do that with, so I've commented out the failing test and
    hopefull it will build now and I can grab the automated build to debug
    the issue.

    IANA assigned port number 6653 to OpenFlow.  However, applications
    (e.g. opendaylight, nox, openvswitch, etc) still use legacy port
    numbers.  The most common are 6633 and 6634.  This patch adds a
    simple heuristic logic and uses the current uint preference as
    additional input.  In most cases no user intervention is needed and
    OpenFlow is automatically detected/dissected.

    Fix Bug 9920 Buildbot crash due to SDP/RTP mismatch
    
    For details see comments in Bug 9920.
    
    The executive summary:
    Bug 9920 is a crash caused by a couple of issues:
    
    1) The memory ownership model for the rtp_dyn_payload hashtable is split: SDP
    creates the rtp_dyn_payload hashtable, but RTP can free it. Since there isn't
    *one* pointer to the hashtable, RTP freeing it means SDP has a dangling
    pointer.
    
    2) Either the SDP dissector shouldn't be creating two separate, unique
    hashtables for multiple media channels of the same addr:port, or RTP shouldn't
    be free'ing the previous one.

Date:   Mon Mar 31 23:58:04 2014 -0400

    Fix checkApis perl script false positive proto_tree_add with ENC_*
    
    In epan/proto.c in function proto_tree_add_split_bits_crumb, the
    proto_tree_add_text function is called with one of its arguments
    using ENC_BIG_ENDIAN, but it's not an argument for proto_tree_add_text
    itself but instead a function being called inside it. checkAPIs.pl
    tries to avoid this in check_proto_tree_add_XXX_encoding, by removing
    parenthesis arguments, but in this acse there are newlines between
    the arguments, causing the regex to not catch them. This commit
    fixes the regex.

    Fix proto.c to pass checkAPIs script
    
    Since proto.c was using strcat(), changes to the file won't pass checkAPIs.
    So this commit replaces it with the appropriate function, and also replaces
    the deprecated tvb_length_remaining and tvb_ensure_length_remaining function
    calls with the new versions, since checkAPIs was warning about that too.
    This commit does not change the ep_* memorry calls to the new wmem-based
    ones though, as that's a bigger deal than this trivial commit I think.

    Use sized strbufs when extracting tvb strings
    
    We rarely know exactly how long a string will be, but we frequently have a good
    lower bound (that's better than the default strbuf size of 16). Starting at that
    size probably reduces the amount of allocation/copying needed.
    
    Also make use of the new _finalize() method to save memory and avoid constness
    problems.

    Splay tree implementation for wmem
    
    This is a tree implementation intended to replace the current red-black tree in
    wmem_tree (which was inherited from emem), assuming there are no regressions.
    Splay trees bubble recently accessed keys to the top, and as such have a number
    of very nice properties: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree
    
    This implementation is a variant known as "independent semi-splaying", which has
    better practical performance. It should do about as well as the red-black tree
    for random insertions and accesses, but somewhat better for patterned accesses
    (such as accessing each key in order, or accessing certain keys very
    frequently).
    
    There are a few other changes relative to the red-black tree implementation that
    are worth mentioning:
     - Instead of requiring complex keys to be split into guint32 chunks and doing
       this weird trick with sub-trees, I let the keys be arbitrary pointers and
       allowed the user to specify an arbitrary comparison function. If the function
       is NULL then the pointers are compared directly for the simple integer-key
       case.
     - Splay trees do not need to store a red-black colour flag for each node. It is
       also much easier to do without the parent pointer in each node. And due to
       the simpler system for complex keys, I was able to remove the "is_subtree"
       boolean. As such, splay nodes are 12 bytes smaller on 32-bit platforms, and
       16 bytes smaller on a 64-bit platform.
    
    All done in about half the lines of code.

    Add handling of OSC over TCP; fix a bug in the UDP heuristic.
    
    Bug Fixed: UDP heuristic wasn't properly setting the dissector
    for the UDP conversation.
    
    From https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9837#c3:
    
     I did a little survey about alternative OSC transmission, but UDP.
    
     As OSC is packet-based, it is tramitted raw via packet-oriented protocols (e.g. UDP).
    
     For reliable stream-based protocols (TCP, USB), the raw OSC packet is
     prefixed with the packets Int32 size as a packetization scheme.
    
     For unreliable stream-based protocols (RS232 and other serial lines),
     the raw OSC packet is SLIP and/or double SLIP encoded as packetization
     scheme.
    
     There was discussion in the past to make SLIP encoding the default for
     all stream-based protocols, but apparently it has never been adopted
     for any OSC via TCP implementation I've found in the web.
    
     As OSC is used in networked Audio, most implementations run with the
     Nagle algorithm disable, and send the prefixed length and the raw OSC
     packet separately.

    Allow chained calls with Lua TreeItem functions, and fix a couple of minor errors.
    
    A common Lua idiom is to use chained calls, i.e. tree:foo():bar():choo(). This actually
    works for tree:add() because it returns the new child tree item which is then the one
    being applied to the next chained call. But it doesn't work beyond that for things like
    set_generated() and so on.  So this commit fixes that.
    
    This also fixes the Lua tree:add() function for the FT_BOOL type to let it be a Lua boolean value.
    And it reverts a previous change to Struct.tohex() to allow coercion of the argument.

    Add filterable expert info for Lua
    
    This adds the ability for a Lua script to register expert info fields,
    similar to C-code dissectors. This change also removes the need for
    the expert_add_info_format_internal() function. Existing Lua scripts
    do not have to change, because the existing expert info function
    uses the internal "_ws.lua" protocol instead of nothing; but using
    the new functionality provides more benefits since it correctly
    registers the expert info fields to the dissector's protocol.
    
    The test suite was amended to generate both old and new forms.

    Bluetooth: Fix wrong recognized RFCOMM services
    
    It seems that RFCOMM service can be dynamically changed while
    connection is still alive. In other words: host can connect to
    remote device and set one RFCOMM service (remote service), but later
    remote device can change service to one of host service without
    any disconnection. This patch add support for this case.
    Also improve searching for useful UUID service through SDP.

    Enhance Lua API doc generator and add more API info
    
    This enhances the Lua API doc generator Perl script to handle
    meta-information in description comments, such as bold, italics,
    raw code, version info, etc.
    
    The supported markup and codes are documented in make-wsluarm.pl.
    
    It's not beautiful Perl code (I don't know Perl), and I'd rather
    do it using Lua, but I think keeping it Perl makes more sense in
    the long run.

    Fix Bug 9915 'GIOP dissector prints non-UTF-8 to Info column'
    
    When the capture file in Bug 9915 is opened in wireshark with GTK2,
    the console prints out 'Pango-WARNING **: Invalid UTF-8' warnings.
    This capture file was a subset of the one in fuzzbot crash bug 9883.
    I believe it is what's causing the crash in 9883, because GTK is
    finicky about such things. But my system doesn't crash for bug 9883,
    so perhaps it's not the same root cause.

    Add way for Lua file reader to save state per file read/write ops
    
    Lua can create a file reader/writer, to open new capture file
    formats or write to new ones. To save local state, it can save
    things in Lua itself; but since there can be multiple open files
    at the same time (for example during a reload), the Lua script
    won't know for which file and state its read/write functions are
    being invoked for. To remedy this, and also provide a convenient
    way to store such state, this commit adds the ability for a Lua
    script to store a Lua table in the wtap/wtap_dumper's priv
    data member, just like C-code-based reader/writers do.

    Fix Bug 9903: 'Clicking reload-file ignores selected file format reader'
    
    There's a relatively new feature in 1.11.3 to select a specific file format
    reader, instead of relying on magics or heuristics. If you select a file
    reader and open a file, open it, and then click the reload-file button or go
    to View->Reload or press the ctrl-R keymap, the file is reloaded but using the
    magic/heuristics again instead of the file format reader you previously chose.
    Likewise, the Lua relaod() function has the same issue (which is how I found
    this problem).
    
    I have tested this change by hand, using a Lua script, but I didn't add it
    to the testsuite because I need another change for my test script to work
    correctly. (an enhancement rather than a bug fix, which I'll submit separately)

    Allow pcapng interface options to be available to dissectors.
    
    Interface options[1], and more generally pcapng options[2], are useful
    information that can provide improved dissector output.
    
    Prior to this change, only certain pcapng interface options were interpreted
    and made available to dissectors, e.g. the interface name or description.
    This change augments the situation by providing epan_get_interface_option( ),
    which returns an array of byte arrays if the option code exists
    (otherwise NULL).  Each element of the array is a byte buffer containing
    the raw data of the option.  An array-of-buffers is used because pcapng
    allows for multiple instances of the same option to be present in the file.
    All interface options found in a pcapng file are thus made available to the
    dissector.
    
    The implementation also provides infrastructure to collect options from
    other pcapng blocks such as the section header.  Currently these options

    Fix lua file testsuite not working and weak heuristic readers not being registered
    
    The testsuite for Lua file reader/writer uses the acme_file.lua script to
    generate a pcapng file from an Acme sipmsg.log file. It then compares the
    tshark verbose output of this new pcapng file to a sip.pcapng file in
    the test/captures directory that was previously made. Unfortunately, the
    acme_file.lua script generates a timestamp based on local system timezone,
    rather than UTC, so the testsuite fails if not run in the EST timezone where
    the sip.pcapng file was originally made. This has now been fixed.
    
    Also, trying to register new weak heuristic readers fails because the GArray
    is terminated with a NULL-based row without Glib knowing about that. So this
    commit changes it to let Glib handle the NULL-terminated row, so that appending
    takes it into account automatically.

    The installer puts the normal included plugins (e.g. mate, wimax) in

    however the global plugins directory is set to
    /Applications/Wireshark.app/Contents/Resources/lib/wireshark/plugins
    (as it was in previous versions) so no plugins load at startup.
    In order to make them load you have to create this directory and
    copy the plugins there, or put them in your personal directory.

    Get rid of unused #defines and no-longer-used structures.
    
    The #defines came from Radiotap, but this isn't Radiotap (I see no
    presence bits here), and Radiotap has to handle stuff that this code
    doesn't (such as, for example, Atheros Wi-Fi adapters that, annoyingly,
    pad the space between the 802.11 header and the 802.11 payload when in
    monitor mode, hence the "datapad" flag).

    Reorganize the code.
    
    Pull the packet data copying code into the routines that parse the rest
    of the record data.  Have those routines directly fill in the metadata
    headers in the packet data, without bothering to fill in a structure
    first.
    
    As a result, those routines no longer can set phdr->caplen to a value
    different from phdr->len, so don't set WTAP_HAS_CAP_LEN.
    
    Have the existing sanity checking code cause the read to fail if the
    checks fail, and add some additional sanity checking.
    
    Use #defines for some offsets into the statistics header and trailer.

    Clean up the setting of the len and caplen fields.
    
    Always include the length of the metadata headers, as we're always
    copying them.
    
    Do a straightforward check to make sure the data length is >= 4 before
    subtracting out the FCS (which appears not to actually be an FCS; at
    least in the captures I've seen, it looks like random junk).
    
    Improve the comments for that code.
    
    Get rid of some tabs, in favor of spaces, while we're at it, and make
    the 3 sections of code where that's done more alike.

    Use constants instead of vwr->STATS_LEN in some cases.
    
    In some cases, we know, based on the FPGA code, what vwr->STATS_LEN is,
    so use that #define.
    
    While we're at it, replace some hardcoded numbers that represent the
    statistics trailer length with the appropriate #define.
    
    Also, combine two identical case arms for Ethernet into one.

    Fix two bugs & do various other changes.
    
    Bugs fixed:
    - Catch exceptions during heuristics test so that the sequence of

      (Prevents incorrect tshark "one-pass" dissection);
    - Comment out registration of heuristic for TCP; TCP dissection
      requires different code than for UDP. ("XXX: ToDo" added)
    
    Misc:
    - Create/use two extended value_strings;
    - "UL" is not needed as a modifier for several constants;
    - Remove some unneeded initializers;
    - Localize some variables;
    - Remove unneeded '#include <stdlib.h>
    - Do some whitespace changes.

    put them at the end of the lists.  That also makes the lists a bit more
    consistent.
    
    (Yes, I know, the wireshark_ldadd list is followed by some other

    Fix bug 9021: 'RTP not decoded inside the conversation in v.1.10.1'
    
    The behavior for SIP/SDP handling of RTP conversation tracking
    changed in v1.10, with some unintended consequences.  The bugs did not
    show up at the time because wireshark makes 2 passes of the packet list,
    and so the problems auto-corrected themselves in most cases.  Unfortunately,
    a change in r53641 modified how UDP behaves, making it always create
    conversations for UDP packets, and that exposed the bugs inherent in the
    SIP/SDP code changes.
    
    This commit reverts the behavior of SIP/SDP to its pre-1.10 model, but
    creates a new preference setting for "Delay SDP changes for tracking media",
    which if enabled, will turn on the new (but buggy) model introduced in 1.10.
    This preference is *disabled* by default, since for a majority of cases the
    new behavior is worse than the previous behavior.
    
    The preference, and this commit's fix, is not intended to last long. I intend
    to re-write the SIP/SDP/RTP interaction model for release 1.11 - I think it's
    too big a change for 1.10, however, which is why I submitted this commit.

    Fix Bug 9872: 'SIP status line in 200 OK for de-registration is misleading'
    
    The status line of the 200 OK during a deregistration is (1 bindings), but it
    should be (0 bindings). Wireshark should check the "expires=0" in the contact
    header not just count the number of the contact lines. But since it's not
    truly valid to have expires=o contacts in responses, this commit adds expert
    info warning of such.
    
    Also, the REGISTER request itself already says "(remove all bindings)"
    in the Info column currently if the Contact was a '*', but it didn't
    say something similar if only de-registering one or more explicit
    contacts. This has been fixed as well.
    
    Lastly, this fixes three other bugs I found while reading the code and testing:
    (1) comma-separated Contact headers will be displayed as a single one if
    the first one(s) don't have header params but a subsequent one does; and
    (2) the last Contact header param is displayed with the trailing '\r\n'
    header separator; and (3) the SIP REGISTER response code displayed contact
    binding info for responses other than 2xx, which isn't logical.
    
    Since all of these are in the same area and not critical, I'm lumping these
    all together.
    
    A test capture file used for testing is attached to the bug.
    
    As an aside, the SIP header parsing code needs to be refactored. Most SIP
    headers follow a common ABNF pattern, and should be parsed using a common
    function(s) so these issues don't crop up for specific headers.

    Fix Bug 9870 'Lua: trying to call/get an invalid name results in a get-loop error'
    
    Due to the change I made previously for how methods are accessed, if you try
    to access one that doesn't exist (for example mistype it or whatever), you get
    an internal Lua error about a loop in table get, as opposed to the right error
    message about the field not existing.
    
    That's because I had set the class' metatable __index metamethod to point to
    the class table, which of course has the metatable with the __index
    metamethod, causing a lookup loop.  Blech.

    Add GLib's regex library into Lua
    
    While Lua's built-in pattern support is ok for simple things, many people end
    up wanting a real regex engine. Since Wireshark already includes the GLib
    Regex library (a wrapper for PCRE), it makes sense to expose that library to
    Lua scripts. This has been done using Lrexlib, one of the most popular regex
    bindings for Lua. Lrexlib didn't support binding GLib's Regex in particular -
    it does for PCRE but GLib is a different API - so I've done that. A fairly
    thorough testsuite came along with that, which has been incorporated into the
    wireshark wslua testuites as well in this commit.

    The bytes view pane in Qt is showing non-ASCII characters in the right-hand

    such. I wouldn't care, except some of those non-ASCII characters affects

    Fix bug 9835 disabled second media stream disables all media streams
    
    When a single media line is rejected in an SDP answer, for example a second
    'm=video' line, wireshark disables ALL media sessions, instead of just that
    one.  But per the RFCs, all it should do is disable just the one RTP media
    session the m= line represents. This commit fixes that, so that a disabled
    media session (one with a m= port of 0) in the SDP answer only disables its
    associated/paired media stream in the offer.

    Have NFLOG TLV type and length be in host byte order.
    
    When capturing, they'll be in host byte order.  The top of the libpcap
    trunk and 1.5 branch, when reading a file, will, if necessary, byte-swap
    the type and length values so that they're in the byte order of the host
    reading the file (rather than the host that wrote the file).
    
    Do the same when we read a file, and have the NFLOG dissector assume
    host byte order for those fields.

    Add command-line arg for input file format for tshark/wireshark
    
    Now that we have the ability to choose input file format type
    in the GUI, we might as well have it in the command-line too.
    Plus it would help me in test-stuies if we had a commandline.
    So I've added a '-X read_format:Foo' for this.  Using just
    '-X read_format:', or with a bad name, will make it print out
    the full list (in tshark); just like the '-F' does for output
    file formats.
    
    Note: I am *not* putting in code for Win32 GUI,
    because I can't compile that and I wouldn't have even
    done the GTK one if I could compile Qt originally. (I don't think we need
    to add any more features to GTK or Win32, just Qt from now on,
    right?)

    Don't truncate the options field.

    do the analysis of fields from the fixed-length portion of the TCP
    header (such as sequence numbers), and then do a straightforward
    dissection of the options, throwing an exception if we run past the end
    of the options field.
    
    This is a bit simpler, and doesn't add confusing notes about
    truncation of the options.
    
    XXX - we're currently not including selective acknowledgments in any of
    the SEQ/ACK analysis; should we?  That means, of course, that we have to
    dissect the options before doing that analysis, and if the options were
    cut short by slicing, you lose....

commit 83b9949
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Mar 3 14:49:20 2014 -0800

    Show ymsg.content as bytes; it's not a simple string.
    
    The content of a YMSG message is a sequence of lines, each one of which
    contains a text string (in some ASCII-based encoding) for a key, a
    0xc080 separator, and a text string (in some ASCII-based encoding) for a
    value.  That's not a string in any ASCII-based encoding I know of - 0xc0
    0x80 is not, for example, a valid UTF-8 sequence (it's a too-long
    sequence for NUL).
    
    This should fix bug 9832:
    
    	https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9832
    
    by avoiding the general "GTK+ on Windows crashes when asked to copy
    something that's not valid UTF-8" problem.
    
    Fix some field descriptions while we're at it.

      different .c files. All the value_string arrays (and most of the #defines)
      moved to packet-fcels.c.
    
    - Other:
      Use -1 instead of tvb_length() for the length param of several proto_tree_add...() calls.

    Create/use an extended value-string; Move value-string array from .h file; Do other misc.
    
    - Value string arrrays should never be defined in a .h file (especially one
       included in multiple .c files).
      So: a. The value_string array (and associated #defines) was moved from the .h file
             to packet-rtp_events.c
          b. A public extended value_string was created in packet-rtp_events.c
              and declared as external in packet-rtp_events.h
    
    - Other:
      Remove a few unneeded initializers;
      Add editor modelines.

    packet-homeplug-av: use HOMEPLUG_AV_MMVER_1_1 consistently
    
    The HomePlug AV dissector was not consistently using the
    HOMEPLUG_AV_MMVER_1_1 constant and was sometimes using it and sometimes
    using mmver == 1 directly. Make sure we use that constant throughout the
    code to help clarifiying which version tests are applying to.

    in a fashion that's a bit less hard to read.
    
    Warn, in comments, of the problems with using
    tvb_get_string()/tvb_get_stringz() (i.e., if your strings are non-ASCII,
    all bytes with the 8th bit set are going be replaced by the Unicode
    REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, and displayed as such).
    
    Warn, in a comment, of the problems with tvb_get_const_stringz() (i.e.,
    it gives you raw bytes, rather than guaranteed-to-be-valid UTF-8).

    Get Windows build working again.
    
    Change 16 / g579e7e1 introduced a breaking change in
    capture_file_dialog.cpp on Windows. This works around the problem
    temporarily until we come up with a proper fix.
    
    Fix a Q_OS_WIN check while we're at it.

commit bd36fe1

Date:   Fri Feb 21 01:11:41 2014 -0500

    Fix bug 6357: Lua all_field_infos() broken within tap/listener
    
    The current API for Lua provides a global function
    "all_field_infos()" which returns all the populated field_info nodes
    in the current proto_tree.
    
    By default all_field_infos() "works", in the literal sense: it returns
    exactly the fields the previous dissectors of the packet have
    populated at that instant of time.  But of course dissectors don't
    populate all the applicable fields most of the time, because of the
    TRY_TO_FAKE_THIS_ITEM optimization where they don't fill in things
    that aren't needed at the time by a display, color, or tap's dfilter.
    
    So this commit offers a way to force the dissectors to populate
    all the applicable field_infos in the tree, by setting the proto_tree
    to be visible.  Obviously that is going to impact performance, since
    it basically bypasses the TRY_TO_FAKE_THIS_ITEM optimization; so the
    patch only does this if the Lua script author told it to explicitly,
    by adding an argument to Listener.new() and register_postdissector().

    Adds some Lua helper functions: some commonly used functions, and to help troubleshooting Lua scripts
    
    There are some common things people need to do, such as convert to/from hex or get
    the raw binary string in a ByteArray/Tvb/TvbRange. These have been added, as well
    as some tests for them in the testsuites. Also, functions have been added to allow
    a script to get all the available tap types and filter fields, since they are
    not exactly what one can see in the Wireshark gui.

    Fix bug 9790: Lua: wslua allows duplicate field registration
    
    As discussed in bug 3513 and 9709, one can register more than one new ProtoFields for
    the same field name. Of course C-code can do that too, and does a LOT apparently, but
    if they're not similar ftypes then things can get scrweed up in display filters.
    
    So this change prevents duplicate field registration of dissimilar ftypes. The
    similarity is based on the discussion on the mailing list, and the listing in
    README.developer has been updated to refelect that as well.
    
    Also, this change adds a testscript for Proto/ProtoFields.

    Add test suite for verifying Lua global variables/tables of previous releases have not disappeared.
    
    Several bugs have been introduced due to changing of perl scripts or #define names, such
    that things exported into Lua have dissapeared or changed unintentionally. This commit
    adds a test suite which compares the Lua global table with the ones from previous
    releases (1.8 and 1.10), to verify nothing has gone missing. New items can be added, but
    old ones cannot go away. The added script to verify these things, called 'verify_globals.lua',
    also has the ability to display what's new - i.e., what was not in the olrder releases.
    
    Lastly, this commit also fixes a bug: MENU_STAT_ENDPOINT became MENU_STAT_ENDPOINT_LIST
    due to a change in the make-init-lua.pl perl script in this 1.11 release.

    Add test suite for verifying Lua global variables/tables of previous releases have not disappeared.
    
    Several bugs have been introduced due to changing of perl scripts or #define names, such
    that things exported into Lua have dissapeared or changed unintentionally. This commit
    adds a test suite which compares the Lua global table with the ones from previous
    releases (1.8 and 1.10), to verify nothing has gone missing. New items can be added, but
    old ones cannot go away. The added script to verify these things, called 'verify_globals.lua',
    also has the ability to display what's new - i.e., what was not in the olrder releases.
    
    Lastly, this commit also fixes a bug: MENU_STAT_ENDPOINT became MENU_STAT_ENDPOINT_LIST
    due to a change in the make-init-lua.pl perl script in this 1.11 release.

    Cleanup on aisle 5: normalizes the Lua code to follow common schema/model
    
    Over time the various wslua classes/functions have gotten moldy, with different
    ways of doing similar things. Some of it can't be changed without breaking
    backwards compatibility for Lua scripts, so I didn't do that. But I did what
    I could. The biggest change is a refactoring of how accessors/attributes
    are handled in the code, so that most of them work the same way using the
    same code.
    
    Specific changes made:
     * Added null/expired checking macro to class declarations for many classes
     * Removed extraneous pointer/expired checking, since checkFoo() does that already
     * Fixed "errors" reported by clang static analyzer; they were false positives, but it was easier to get it to stop complaining by changing the code
     * Moved internal wslua functions from wslua_utils.c into a new 'wslua_internals.c' file
     * Changed Listener/NSTime/Pinfo/Proto to use a common setter/getter accessor/attribute code model, instead of each of them doing their own
     * Fixed some API doc mistakes, mostly around attributes that were documented as read-only but were actually read-write

    Force "printing" if -T is specified, even if -w is also specified.
    
    Just as "tshark ... -P -w xxx" writes raw packets to xxx *and* writes
    text packet summaries to the standard output, and just as "tshark ...
    -V -w xxx" writes raw packets to xxx *and* writes text packet details to
    the standard output, so should "tshark ... -T fff -w xxx" write raw
    packets to xxx *and* write whatever "-T fff" (and any "-e" options)
    specifies to the standard output.

                                     which is not valid forthis field.
      + OPTION_CCCV6_IETF_PROV_SRV: Replace use of swap_field_length_with_char();
                                    Fix bug which caused invalid "expert" message.
      + OPTION_CCCV6_KRB_REALM:     Remove validation; replace use of swap_field_length_with_char().
    
    - Allow filtering for each different FQDN field (rather than using a generic "dhcpv6.domain"
       for the various FQDN fields).
    
    - Fix some bugs in the display of the dissection for NTP_SERVER_OPTION;
    - Add some "XXX ToDo" comments.
    - Add some comments as the to specific RFC for certain options;
    - Note that RFC 4075 is now "deprecated";
    - CL-SP-CANN-DHCP-Reg: version I10 is the latest as  Feb 2014.

    openSAFETY: Reduce overload and display gap data
    
     Up until now, openSAFETY hooked into a heuristic filter for epl
     and dissected the whole package, handing back some epl header
     information by calling epl again. This was time-consuming and
     on a busy network led to an increase in dropped packages and
     memory usage, as well as unresponsivness.
    
     This patch only takes the payload data of epl frames, and
     therefore greatly reduces the dissection overhead of openSAFETY.
    
     On a second note, intergap data between safety frames is now
     being displayed as Data, but only if the option for doing so
     is specifically enabled in the openSAFETY preferences, as it
     changes the behaviour of the dissector output.
    
     Upd: Because of the gap handling, some frames where marked
     as being truncated, although they were not, or did not contain
     openSAFETY frames at all. In the course of the fix for this,
     the byte copying for the byte swap with MBTCP has been moved
     to only occur when needed, and is additionaly guarded.
    
     Upd2: Identation and comment fixes
    
     Upd3: Change memcpy to memdup and move find_dissector ( "data" )
     to proto_reg_handoff
    
    PLK: Store data dissector pointer
    
     Move the if-clause to proto_reg_handoff as documented
     in comment of Change-id: 191

    Powerlink: New heuristic payload dissection
    
     Up until now, the heuristic dissector for epl allways passed the
     complete epl frame. Therefore a lot of information got passed,
     which was not needed, resulting in subdissectors to have to call
     the epl dissector again, if the epl data had to be dissected.
    
     This patch adds a second heuristic dissector (not breaking the
     way, the existing one is working), which only passes the payload
     of the epl frame to a sub-dissector, therefore reducing memory
     overhead and increasing dissection speed.
    
     Upd: Changes according to comments in patchset

    Statistics->Flow Graph in qtshark crashes with a segfault
    
    What appears to be happening is SequenceDiagram::draw() is iterating over the stored seq_analysis_item_t elements - but at the same time SequenceDialog::fillDiagram() is running - which destroys the old seq_analysis_info_t (which SequenceDiagram has stored a copy of and is referencing items in the list) then reloads it.
    
    I'll attach a patch to SequenceDialog::fillDiagram() which fixes the problem - essentially calling sequence_analysis_list_get() with a new seq_analysis_info_t, calling SequenceDialog::setData() with the new one, then destroying the current seq_analysis_info_t and replacing it with the new on

    Add test suite for Lua dissector-related functions
    
    This isn't super-fancy, but it runs a simple protocol dissector and verifies the tshark output
    matches what it expects.  Things like Proto, ProtoField, Field, Tvb, TvbRange, etc., are used
    in an example dissector script - it dissects DNS... partially.  Enough to make sure things
    aren't fundamentally broken.  This provides something to add on top of later as well.

    Fix bug 9736 'Lua: new Int64/UInt64 functions don't prevent division by zero'
    
    OK, in all fairness this does a bit more than just fix that bug. It also
    adds a 'Int64()' and 'UInt64()' __call metamethods. I generally dislike
    using __call metamethods, because they're often unintuitive (for example
    the wireshark Field and FielInfo use this in a bizarre fashion).  But this
    happens to be a perfect use for it, and very natural, imho.  Another change
    is to make the metatables of classes visible to scripts. There was never
    really a good reason not to make them visible, and they have to be visible
    to do things like use __call on a plain table... not to mention I need them
    to be visible to run test scripts verifying evrything is kosher.
    
    I also updated the test suite to test for the div/mod by zero.

    which is quite annoying.  This commit makes clang/gcc ignore the deprecated attribute,
    for gcrypt.h only.  The danger with this is if gcrypt ever deprecates a function
    we actually *use*, then we won't see the warning.  So I'm not sure if it's a good or
    bad idea to do this change, but it's really annoying to see the warnings and makes
    finding real warnings difficult.

    Licensecheck improvements, just two errors left.
    
    Spawned from https://www.wireshark.org/lists/wireshark-dev/201402/msg00024.html
    
    Add some ignore rules for files that can't/shouldn't include a license header.
    
    Reorganize some ignore rules to group rules with similar motivations.
    
    Add a header to autogen.sh and attribute it to just "The Wireshark Authors"
    since while Gilbert wrote the original version it's gone through so many changes
    over the years that sorting out proper authorship is unnecessarily complex.
    
    Add headers to Graeme Hewson's two files as verified by private email, and
    update his address in the AUTHORS file per his request.
    
    Add header to one of Ulf Lamping's files, as verified by private email.
    
    Only remaining problem is the reedsolomon code.

    Fix bug 9733 ' Lua: wtap_filetypes.TSPREC_ variable names are missing from the Lua global table'
    
    The fix for bug 9712, which involved changing the make-init-lua.pl perl script
    to handle the new C-code define names for filetypes in release 1.11,
    unfortunately also stopped matching against the timestamp define names.
    
    Arguably the timestamp ones should never have been matched to begin with, at
    least not by the same regex function, because they're not "filetypes".  But
    they've been matched and exported into the Lua table forever, so we'll break
    backward-compat if we don't keep doing it. Ugh.
    
    The good news is I caught this bug using a new test script I wrote which
    verifies previous release's Lua stuff didn't disappear.  I'll submit that
    separately when I get a chance to clean it up, hopefully next week.

    Fix bug 9732: ' Lua: recent commit changed some MENU_ key names in init.lua'
    
    A recent fix (made by me) for bug 9707, in Change-Id:
    If4ee1906aa60dd37366cf2ef9bc4168e0ea024b6, made the perl regex grab too much
    of the menu name.  It changed MENU_STAT_CONVERSATION, MENU_STAT_RESPONSE, and
    MENU_ANALYZE_CONVERSATION's key names into their longer C-code names.  Ugh.
    
    The fix for this is a bit brittle, but I think it's impractical to avoid it
    being brittle, due to needing to support legacy Lua scripts.  I put comments
    in stat_menu.h to warn of the danger.

    Make some routines take a struct wtap_pkthdr * as an argument.
    
    For some routines that take multiple arguments that come from a struct
    wtap_pkthdr, pass a pointer to the struct wtap_pkthdr in question,
    rather than the separate arguments.  Do this even if we're passing
    expressions that were earlier assigned to the struct wtap_pkthdr fields
    in question.  This simplifies the calling sequences and ensures that the
    right values are picked up by the called routine; in at least one case
    we were *not* passing the right values (the code to handle Simple Packet
    Blocks in pcap-ng files).
    
    Also, call the byte-swapping routines for pseudo-header fields only if
    we need to do byte-swapping.

commit 2e7f771
Author: Hadriel Kaplan <hadrielk@yahoo.com>
Date:   Sun Feb 2 22:49:30 2014 -0500

    Adds support for Lua Int64 and UInt64 operators, functions, and general
    usefulness, working around bug #9162 until Lua 5.3 is released.
    
    The existing Int64 and UInt64 classes provide virtually no
    usefullness, other than for creating a string of their value.  While
    one could then write Lua code to convert the string to Lua numbers and
    such, ultimately Lua has no native 64-bit integer support, making such
    a task difficult to handle in Lua.  This change adds a host of
    functions and operators to the existing Int64 (gint64) and UInt64
    (guint64) classes, to enable true 64-bit integer support on par with
    native Lua numbers.
    
    A test script is also provided, which tests the functions/operators.

commit 4cc6948
Author: Gilbert Ramirez <gram@alumni.rice.edu>
Date:   Thu Jan 30 09:43:52 2014 -0800

    Fix all -fstrict-alias warnings found by gcc 4.1.2
    
    The majority of the fixes are for calls to uat_new(). Instead of
    having each caller cast its private data to (void**), we use void*
    in the uat_new() API itself. Inside uat_new(), we cast the void*
    to void**.
    
    Some dissectors use val64_string arrays, so a VALS64() macro was
    added for those, to avoid using VALS(), which is useful only for
    value_string arrays.
    
    packet-mq.c was changed because dissect_nt_sid() requires
    a char**, not a guint**. All other callers of dissect_nt_sid() use
    char*'s (and take the address of it) for their local storage. So,
    this was changed to follow the other practices.
    
    A confusion between gint and absolute_time_display_e in packet-time.c
    was cleared up.
    
    The ugliest fix is the addition of ip6_guint8_to_str(), for exactly
    one caller. The caller uses one type of ip6 address byte array,
    while ip6_to_str() expects another. This new function is in place
    until the various address implementations can be consolidated.
    
    Add VALS64() to the developer documentation.

    Add remove_last_data_source and fix bug 9169
    
    The OP asked 9169 to be reopened because the capture was spewing ~40GB of output
    when dissected with tshark. Investigation showed this was because the HTTP
    dissector was requesting ONE_MORE_PACKET reassembly a lot, and TCP was adding
    each step as a data-source which was being printed by tshark's hex dump. This
    was leading to O(n^2) of output.
    
    To fix, introduce function remove_last_data_source which removes the most recent
    data source from the list. If the subdissector in TCP reassembly asks for
    ONE_MORE_PACKET, assume it hasn't added any tree items (since it shouldn't have)
    and remove the data source since it is unnecessary.
    
    This may break dissectors which add tree items and *then* return
    ONE_MORE_PACKET, since they will have their data source removed out from under
    them. I believe those cases should be fixed to not add tree items until they're
    sure they have enough data.

    Fix display of right arrow in CSV export
    
    Changeset 1d8a895fa4d7c16d213bda50b1177eccbb54326e introduced the use of UTF-8 righ arrow to indicate the direction in TCP dissector.
    While it displays nicely in Wireshark GUI or in a text export of packets, an export to CSV results in an escaped string.
    This patch is a naive attempt to display the right arrow in a more friendly way when exporting to CSV.
    Any smarter fix is welcome.

commit a7ea594
Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 24 20:48:55 2014 +0000

    The wimax plugin primarily uses tvb_get_ptr buffer accesses instead of the
    safe accessor functions, and it's all done via scary bit-twiddling macros to
    boot.
    
    Create the macros TVB_NIB_WORD and TVB_NIB_NIBBLE that (should) behave just
    like the raw-pointer NIB_WORD and NIB_NIBBLE macros, except using the safe tvb
    functions instead.
    
    Replace two instances with the safe versions, which fixes an out-of-bounds
    access caught by my valgrind fuzzer. If this doesn't break anything then we
    should probably do a wholesale replacement at some point, but I'm not feeling
    that adventurous at the moment.

commit 1bd982a
Author: Bill Meier <wmeier@newsguy.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 24 20:19:06 2014 +0000

    Rework and simplify the code to follow the principle of "dissect as
     much as possible" rather than dissecting nothing if the length of a
     set of fields (e.g., a "command") seems wrong or if an exception
     occurs fetching data before previous fields have been displayed.
    In general: just fetch/dissect from start to end: If there is missing
       data, a Wireshark exception will eventually occur;
    
    Add lwm subtrees under the lwm protocol tree (*not* as protocols
     under the top (outermost) tree.
    
    Fix a bug which caused an exception to be reported as:
     "[Packet size limited during capture: LwMesh truncated]"
     rather than as the correct: "[Malformed...]"
    
    col_...() and expert...() functions shouldn't be called under 'if(tree)';
    
    Register the heuristic dissector using "IEEE802154_PROTOABBREV_WPAN"
     (like certain other dissectors) rather than using "wpan";
    
    missmatch --> mismatch
    
    Fix some long lines.

commit 8997fb0
Author: Gerald Combs <gerald@wireshark.org>
Date:   Fri Jan 24 18:55:27 2014 +0000

    Start migrating the Developer's Guide to AsciiDoc. So far only one
    chapter (WSDG_chapter_sources) has been converted.
    
    Conversion was done using the script in
    https://code.wireshark.org/review/#/c/9/ along with manual cleanup.
    Changes are mostly limited formatting.
    
    It's helpful to have a copy of the pre-conversion guide for comparison.
    I've placed a chunked copy online at
    http://www.wireshark.org/~gerald/wsdg_html_2014_01/ .
    
    Tested under Autotools. Nmake and CMake will likely break. I'll take a
    look shortly. If only we had documention adding a feature branch to
    Gerrit and using it to test different platforms...

    offset in the tvbuff of the beginning of the packet to it.  Otherwise,
    it will never be zero, and the tests will always think the field pointed
    to by the offset is present.

commit 2019647
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Wed Jan 22 20:05:17 2014 +0000

    At least according to
    
    	http://web.archive.org/web/20080308233204/http://dev.aol.com/aim/oscar/#SNAC
    
    "In general strings are not NULL terminated and are encoded using UTF8."
    
    It also says
    
    	Authentication
    
    	Over the years, the AIM backend has supported several different
    	methods for authentication. ...
    
    	When a client collects the loginId and password for the user it
    	should not normalize them in any manner.  It also should not
    	prevent the user from entering certain characters as the AIM
    	name space is constantly changing.  For example, currently the
    	AIM name space is ASCII based, but in the future that may
    	change.  In general, the client should not perform input
    	checking and instead allow the backend to reject bad values.
    
    which also suggests not assuming ASCII.
    
    So use ENC_UTF_8 in most cases.
    
    For actual messages, it says:
    
    	An IM can be encoded in the following different forms:
    
    	Name	Value	Notes
    	ASCII	0	ANSI ASCII -- ISO 646
    	UNICODE	2	ISO 10646.USC-2 Unicode
    	LATIN_1	3	ISO 8859-1
    
    so, if that's the case, the dissector should choose beween
    ENC_ASCII|ENC_NA, ENC_UCS_2|ENC_appropriate_ENDIAN, and
    ENC_ISO_8859_1|ENC_NA.
    
    Use tvb_get_string_enc() with an encoding rather than tvb_get_string().

commit 051cb78
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Wed Jan 22 04:27:15 2014 +0000

    To quote section B.5 "Keys for password integrity mode" of PKCS #12
    v1.1: Personal Information Exchange Syntax:
    
    	http://www.emc.com/emc-plus/rsa-labs/pkcs/files/h11301-wp-pkcs-12v1-1-personal-information-exchange-syntax.pdf
    
    "When password integrity mode is used to protect a PFX PDU, a password
    and salt are used to derive a MAC key.  As with password privacy mode,
    the password is a Unicode string, and the salt is a byte string."
    
    So, not having found any other references to salts as text strings, copy
    it with tvb_memdup(), not tvb_get_string().

    Strings in LDAP are generally UTF-8, although if we treat something only

Date:   Tue Jan 21 08:50:35 2014 +0000

    Check the return of wtap_dump_close() even if we've gotten a read error;
    the only reason not to check it is if we've already gotten a write error
    and another write error would be superfluous (either "you got two of the
    same error" or "you got an I/O error *and* you ran out of disk
    space/disk quota" is of limited interest).
    
    Discard the return value of wtap_dump_close() in the case where we've
    already gotten a write error, in the hopes of squelching a Coverity
    warning.

    set(DUMPCAP_INSTALL_OPTION   <val>)
    where val is one of "normal" "suid" "capabilities"
    
    Some things left to do:
    - Error out in cmake if setcap isn't found or libcap isn't found.
    - Move multivalue option handling into it's own macro (-file) with
      value checking

commit dae8660
Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 15 02:09:11 2014 +0000

    Reject pcap files that claim on-the-wire packet sizes > 64MB. This fixes many
    heuristic cases broken in r49999 when we permitted packets > 64KB, since that
    relaxed so severely the definition of a valid packet header.
    
    64MB is an arbitrary and perhaps suboptimal number, but it seems to do the right
    thing in all the examples I have handy.

Date:   Tue Jan 14 10:50:26 2014 +0000

    Whoever in GLibland was responsible for defining the signature of
    g_snprintf() owes the world a huge apology.  They *could* have just used
    size_t, or they *could* at least have, if they insisted on having GLib
    types to mirror regular types, made gsize an alias for size_t and,
    whatever they did with gsize, they *could* have used it as the argument
    for the size of the buffer for g_snprintf(), but no, they had to use
    gulong.

    Have ip6_to_str() and tvb_ip6_to_str() return const pointers, as the
    ip_to_str equivalents do.
    
    Don't cast away constness, and don't make it necessary to do so.

commit 720cfe4
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Jan 14 05:23:48 2014 +0000

    Don't cast away constness.  In one place, this requires that we use one
    pointer while we're filling in a string and then assigning it to a const
    pointer when we're done.
    
    Don't use guint16 as a size value; it does no good (it doesn't magically
    protect you againt too-long strings), it runs the potential risk of
    overflow, it doesn't save time for arithmetic (32-bit or 64-bit
    arithmetic may well be faster, and will at least be as fast), and it
    doesn't save space (if it fits in a register, you save nothing, and if
    it's on the stack, there will probably be padding.

    In a source file that defines external functions, the header file that
    declares the functions must be included, in order to make sure the
    declarations match the function signature.  Make it so.
    
    They *didn't* match; fix that.
    
    Do *not* use 16-bit tvbuff offsets; there is no advantage to that (and,
    in fact, 32-bit arithmetic may be easier on some platforms), and it has
    the disadvantage that you're more likely to have the offset overflow.
    
    dissect_cbs_serial_number() returns the new offset, not the length of
    the item it dissected; don't add its return value to the offset, set the
    offset to its return value.
    
    Make dissect_cbs_message_identifier() return the new offset as well, for
    consistency, and don't add *its* return value to the offset.

    Rename WIRESHARK_COMMON_SRC to SHARK_COMMON_SRC - what's common about it
    is that it includes files used in TShark and rawshark as well as
    Wireshark, and that name is what's used by the autotools.
    
    Add capture_sync.c to SHARK_COMMON_CAPTURE_SRC, as it's used both by
    Wireshark and TShark, but not by rawshark, and as it's in the autotools
    SHARK_COMMON_CAPTURE_SRC.  Move PLATFORM_CAPTURE_SRC from
    (WIRE)SHARK_COMMON_SRC to SHARK_COMMON_CAPTURE_SRC, as it should only be
    used by programs that capture traffic.

    TFShark (Terminal Fileshark) v.001.  Bug 9607 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9607)
    
    This is a VERY PRELIMINARY version of tfshark.  It's an attempt to jumpstart FileShark and its architecture.  Right now it's mostly just a very stripped down version of tshark with all of the necessary build modifications (including now building filetap library since tfshark depends on it)
    
    This code has helped me identify what I believe to be all of the necessary layers for a complete fileshark architecture.  And those layers will slowly be added in time (patches always welcome!).

commit 492883c
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Wed Jan 1 23:22:53 2014 +0000

    If the uncompression buffers are empty, they have no data; set the count
    of bytes in them to 0, as there's no data in them, and set the offset in
    that buffer of the stream's current position, to 0, as we're currently
    at the beginning of the file in both streams.
    
    This fixes some tricky-to-reproduce errors (which show up only if the
    ngsniffer_t structure is allocated from data that's been allocated,
    written to in those variables, and freed).

    Filetap library, version 0.001
    
    This is intended as the "tap library" for fileshark.  Right now its basically just a very stripped down (and renamed) copy of the wiretap library.  The goal is to remove "capture" and "wire" specific functionality out of the file handling to make it easier/simpler to support non-capture type files in the epan architecture.

    Small changes (mainly textual) to packet-scsi.c
    
    The attached patch fixes small issues in SCSI dissection:
    1. Extends the meaning of some fields (for example, the mysterious 'LBPME' becomes 'LBPME (logical block provisioning management enabled) / TPE'
    2. Adds another ASC value which is important to me - 'Thin Provisioning Soft Threshold Reached' . Added comment where to get all of them (at  http://www.t10.org/lists/asc-alph.txt or http://www.t10.org/lists/asc-num.txt)
    3. Fixes a small typo: scsi.extcopy.dest_lba is 'Destination LBA', not 'Source LBA' (silly copy-paste mistake).

Date:   Thu Dec 26 03:45:12 2013 +0000

    Since the documentation states that, "Text2pcap understands a hexdump of the form generated by od -Ax -tx1 -v.", supply an example that actually matches that format.
    
    In addition, change the hex bytes so that they represent a valid, well-formed packet, rather than a malformed RSVP packet.  This should allow a user to more clearly verify that the text2pcap converstion worked as expected in the event he/she desires to test text2pcap using the example provided.

commit 6535f89
Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Tue Dec 24 23:41:24 2013 +0000

    Make many fields filterable.  Used convert_proto_tree_add_text.pl to do a "first pass" at converting proto_tree_add_text calls since this dissector is the worse (ab)user (by volume) of proto_tree_add_text and the "coding style" is very conducive to having convert_proto_tree_add_text.pl correctly guessing the field info.
    
    Another pass or two of convert_proto_tree_add_text.pl (with more manual intervention) is needed to be a "proper" dissector, but it gets it off of the checkAPIs.pl "naughty list" in time for Christmas.

    Some warning options are, for reasons not entirely obvious to me, not

    of gcc supports them.  Other versions of g++, and clang, support them.
    
    Check, before adding a -W option for C++, whether the compiler supports
    it; that check must be done with -Werror, at least with g++, in order to
    get a non-zero exit status from the compiler.

Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Sun Dec 22 18:18:12 2013 +0000

    Overhaul the ISIS dissectors
    
    1. Make real dissectors and call dissector_try_uint_new for each "isis.type"
    2. Use make_register script for dissector initialization
    3. Replace isis_dissect_unknown() with real expert info
    4. Use convert_proto_tree_add_text.pl to make many more filterable items and gets some files off of the checkAPIs.pl naughty list.
    5. Remove (now unnecessary) dissector specific header files
    6. Do some reordering of functions to eliminate the need for function declarations.
    
    Additional whitespace formatting and modelines should probably be applied to all of these dissectors.
    
    Used capture files from bug 5354 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5354) and bug 1792 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1792) for fuzztesting.

Date:   Sun Dec 22 08:45:57 2013 +0000

    Add UCS-4 support, and use it.
    
    Shuffle the character ENC_ values around a bit, keeping the Unicode
    encodings together, moving the Windows code pages (only one for now)
    after the ISO 8859 encodings, and putting "I can't believe it's not
    ASCII!" at the end.
    
    Fix some comment typoes, and update another comment, while we're at it.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>

    We support ENC_UCS_2, so use that in proto_tree_add_item() and
    tvb_get_string_enc() rather than using iconv to convert it to UTF-8.

    Add bytestring_to_str() which takes a wmem scope and is otherwise identical to
    bytestring_to_ep_str (now deprecated). Use the new one in a few obvious places.
    
    Also just print directly to the buffer when loading ethernet addresses for
    resolution. The straight-to-buffer bytes_to_hexstr seems useful, maybe it
    shouldn't be in a private header...

commit a6415ec
Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Dec 19 15:49:09 2013 +0000

    Rename a couple of to_str functions to have ep_ in the name. This makes it
    obvious that the returned string is ephemeral, and opens up the original names
    in the API for versions that take a wmem pool (and thus can work in any scope).

commit 317b828
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Thu Dec 19 09:19:33 2013 +0000

    Use proto_tree_add_item() or tvb_get_string_enc() instead of
    tvb_get_unicode_string().  If there's an indication that the encoding is
    UCS-2, use that, otherwise use UTF-16.  (For example, "BMP" stands for
    "Basic Multilingual Plane", which is the part of Unicode that can be
    encoded in 16 bits, hence UCS-2.)
    
    In the description of the "Use Heuristics for UDP" preference for the
    XML dissector, note that it's not just trying to recognize XML in UCS-2,
    it's trying to recognize XML in *big-endian* UCS-2.

    Some patches from Peter Harris:
    
    [PATCH 1/5] X11 dissector: Sort declarations
    This prevents pointless changes showing up in the diff when evaluating
    unrelated changes to the generator.
    
    See http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl-5.18.0/pod/perldelta.pod#Hash_randomization
    
    [PATCH 2/5] X11 dissector: Silence warnings on perl 5.18, prevent 5.20
    Perl 5.18 retroactively marked "given/when" experimental, with a
    promise to remove or dramatically change it in 5.20.
    
    Since there is no perl 5.20 yet, there is no way to make this script
    compatible with it.
    
    [PATCH 3/5] X11 dissector: Support variable_param (at least for glCallLists)
    (This patch makes the change in r54232 unnecessary by using the previously-
    unused variable.)
    
    [PATCH 4/5] X11 dissector: Remove obsolete TODO item
    This item was done in r53531 PATCH 09/11

commit 4c4af54
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Wed Dec 18 21:36:15 2013 +0000

    Use FT_STRING for string-valued fields.
    
    Have RDP_FI_STRING set for all string-valued fields, with:
    
    	RDP_FI_UNICODE set if the string is always "Unicode" (assumed to
    	be UTF-16-encoded);
    
    	RDP_FI_ANSI set if the string is always "ANSI" (we should try to
    	use the code page indication);
    
    	neither set if the string is "Unicode" or "ANSI" depending on
    	the INFO_UNICODE flag in the packet (the only strings that work
    	that way are in TS_INFO_PACKET or TS_EXTENDED_INFO_PACKET
    	packets, which also have the flags field with INFO_UNICODE).
    
    Use proto_tree_add_item() to add the string items.
    
    While we're at it, pull the code to get conversation data, creating it
    if necessary, into a routine.

Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Dec 17 22:38:40 2013 +0000

    Fix what appears to be a misuse of pointers in the LLDP dissector as caught by
    Alexis's ASAN fuzzing. Pass the address of a guid on the stack, not the address
    of a pointer to a guid which doesn't actually point to anything...

Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Tue Dec 17 17:32:20 2013 +0000

    General cleanup of ZBEE ZCL dissector.  Removed unnecessary casts and wrapping functions.
    
    Tried to remove zcl_cluster_id global, but it's used in a function that is called by other dissectors that I'm not sure if they are expecting the zcl_cluster_id to be "saved" (or if -1 could be passed in for cluster id from those dissectors).  Removed as many uses of it as possible if someone knows the dissectors better to make that call.

    Zbee ZCL wrong cmdID in DefaultRespons
    
    Default Response command generated by Specific command cluster contains wrong cmdId decoding. The value shows the cross-cluster command id but not the specific cluster command id name.
    Draft of solution is already created (now is under test). The idea is to add a cmdId function callback in zbee_zcl_init_cluster in order to call it when wireshark has to decode specific cluster cmd in default response.

    From Peter Lemenkov:
    
     "This patch removes misleading dereferencing operator from the
      array's name. E.g. consider the following declaration:
    
      guint32 ipaddr[4];
    
      ipaddr points to the address of an array of guint32's, while &ipaddr
      points to the first' guint32 object. E.g. &ipaddr == &ipaddr[0]. The
      value is the same, but has different type which is necessary
      sometimes. However inet_pton treats latest argument as void*, and
      this information is left anyway. So no need to bother with types and
      let's just pass pointer to the array."

    In dissect_ndr_byte_array(), use the field index from the dcerpc_info
    structure, rather than a fixed field.  Get rid of that fixed field, as
    it's no longer needed.
    
    Use dissect_ndr_byte_array() rather than dissect_ndr_char_cvstring() in
    a case where we have an opaque byte array.
    
    Have dissect_ndr_cvstring() and dissect_ndr_vstring() - and, therefore,
    routines that call them, such as dissect_ndr_cstring(),
    dissect_ndr_char_cvstring(), dissect_ndr_char_vstring(), and
    dissect_ndr_wchar_vstring() - require that the field being used by an
    FT_STRING field.  Manually fix a case where the PIDL generator makes
    such a field FT_NONE rather than FT_STRING.  Also handle EBCDIC, just in
    case we happen to see a packet with EBCDIC strings.
    
    Use tvb_get_string_enc(), rather than tvb_get_unicode_string() or
    tvb_get_string(), in dissect_ndr_cvstring() and dissect_ndr_vstring().

    PSK stream does not get decrypted with other TLS streams
    
    Fix PSK decryption with keylog file
    
    Session IDs may be empty (length zero). Currently, these sessions are
    still stored in the session cache which is quite useless as is is very
    likely that multiple TLS streams have no Session ID in their Hello
    messages. This causes the wrong premaster secret to be restored when the
    ClientHello is dissected (via dissect_ssl3_hnd_hello_common).
    
    In the PSK case, this will prevent the SSL keylog file from being
    consulted. When processing the ClientKeyExchange, the
    ssl_generate_pre_master_secret function is called to set the pre-master
    key... but this does not happen when ssl.psk is not available. In this
    case, the PMK that was restored in ClientHello is used. This results in
    faulty dissection.
    
    RSA does not have this problem because it always tries to use the
    private server key (and falls back to the keylog file).
    
    This fix prevents empty session IDs from being stored with a PMK,
    making the dissector use the keylog file for PSK.

commit 2754c08
Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Dec 14 14:11:30 2013 +0000

    From Peter Paluch via https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9158
    
    Currently, the LLC dissector in packet-llc.c displays the values of DSAP IG bit
    and SSAP CR bit as separate items in the proto tree. This gives an impression
    that these entries are separate fields in the LLC header while in reality, they
    are only the least significant bits in DSAP/SSAP octets. In addition, the
    importance of these bits is relatively low in today's LLC-based protocols (they
    are mostly set to 0), so having them always displayed in the proto tree is
    somewhat of a luxury.
    
    Modify the LLC dissector by having added a subtree to both DSAP and SSAP items
    that displays the IG and CR bits as bits in a bitfield, and moved the display
    of IG and CR bits into these subtrees.
    
    It may seem that adding a text item instead of a FT_UINT8 value is not a
    sensible approach because such item is not filterable. However, if filtering by
    the entire DSAP/SSAP value (which is the typical way of filtering on SAPs), this
    value is always added to the tree in its entirety and indexed by "llc.dsap" and
    "llc.ssap" filter strings. If the GI or CR bit are to be matched, "llc.dsap.ig"
    and "llc.ssap.cr" filter strings are available. Searching for the value of the
    DSAP/SSAP & 0xFE which would be the value currently added by the
    proto_tree_add_text() is not done and should not be done, as IEEE stipulates:
    "An individual actual address value does not necessarily have any relationship
    with a group address of the same actual address value."
    (http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/llc.pdf) Following this
    consideration, the choice of displaying the SAP "actual address" using
    proto_tree_add_text() is acceptable.

    Capture Interfaces dialog cleanup.
    
    Apply layouts as needed to allow resizing. Select the interface list by
    row. We might want to switch the interface list to a QTreeWidget. Today
    I learned that you can make QGroupBox titles checkable. Do that where we
    enable and disable groups of items. Flatten all of the group boxes.
    Change the output format combo to radio buttons. There are only two
    choices and we have lots of real estate available. Use a
    QDialogButtonBox so Qt can size and order the buttons appropriately.

    DLTS: add cipher version for OpenSSL pre 0.9.8f
    
    OpenSSL pre 0.9.8f uses the TLS version 0x0100 and is not completely
    compatible with DTLS 1.0 or 1.2. One difference is that the encrypted
    pre master from TLS 1.0 does not have an own length, which is needed by
    TLS and DTLS 1.0, this makes decrypting impossible. This patch makes it
    possible for the code to distinguish between this OpenSSL version and
    real DTLS 1.0, because they are not using the same code any more. This
    is needed to fix the snakeoil-dtls test.

    From Peter Wu
    
    ssl-utils: remove SIG, rename mode and formatting
    
    The changes seem huge, but actually involve a few structural changes
    that do not change functionality, but aim to make maintenance easier and
    lines shorter. The following changes were made:
    
     1. Remove the "sig" field and `SIG_*` constants as they are not used
        anywhere.
     2. Convert `SSL_CIPHER_MODE_*` macros to an enum, change the type in
        SslCipherSuite, change the field terminator in cipher_suites and
        drop the `SSL_CIPHER_` prefix to make it shorter.
     3. Add whitespace to align the cipher suites and convert the numbers to
        hex to match common usage (e.g. IANA docs). Done with the awk script
        below.
    
    AWK script that takes the lines with `,KEX_` and applies changes (3):
    
        #!/usr/bin/gawk -f
        BEGIN { FS="[, {]+" }
        {
            split($0, c, "}, *");
            comment="";if(c[2])comment="   "c[2];
            sub("}", "", $10); # comment }
            printf("    {0x%04X,%-12s%-16s%2d,%3d,%3d,%-11s %-22s},%s\n",
                   strtonum($2),
                   $3 ",", # Key exchange
                   # $4 is SIG_ - remove

commit 3889cfc
Author: Gerald Combs <gerald@wireshark.org>
Date:   Tue Dec 10 22:38:35 2013 +0000

    From Deon van der Westhuysen via bug 9537:
    
    ----
    The qt version of wireshark (stats_tree_dialog.cpp) by default expands
    all nodes within a stats_tree (see for example the "Statistics" > "IP
    Statistics" > "IP Destinations" stats_tree; you need this patch
    installed before the item is added to the stats menu:
    https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9528). This
    behaviour is fine for small trees but becomes counter productive in
    trees with many items or levels.
    
    This patch changes the qt ui to act like the gtk ui: the first level of
    nodes are expanded by default while deeper levels are collapsed.
    ----
    
    From me: "Expand all" makes sense for a small number of items. Do so if
    we have less than 100.

commit 17a67c3
Author: Gerald Combs <gerald@wireshark.org>
Date:   Tue Dec 10 19:23:26 2013 +0000

    Get the "Decode As" dialog working, albeit with a few warts. It differs
    from the GTK flavor in two major ways:
    
    - The "Decode As" and "User Specified Decodes" dialog have been unified.
    - You can modify the decode as behavior at any time, not just when you
      have a packet selected.
    
    Revert part of 53498 so that we can move items marked
    
    /*** THE FOLLOWING SHOULD NOT BE USED BY ANY DISSECTORS!!! ***/
    
    from epan/decode_as.h to ui/decode_as_utils.h.
    
    Move "save" code from decode_as_dlg.c to decode_as_utils.c as well.
    
    In packet-dcerpc.c don't register a table named "ethertype". We might
    want to add checks for duplicate table names.
    
    To do:
    - Add support for ranges?
    - Either add support for DCERPC or make DCERPC use a regular dissector
      table.
    - Fix string selectors (i.e. BER).

    Note: We *might* want to do _something_ but that _something_ should be well-defined and consistent across all dissectors.  Previously, some dissectors called proto_tree_add_text() to add some error message text to the tree, while others called DISSECTOR_ASSERT().

commit 125a17f
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Thu Dec 5 09:30:22 2013 +0000

    Initialize the error-reporting routines before scanning for plugins, as
    the code to scan for them uses those routines.
    
    This means epan_init() no longer takes those routines as arguments -
    which is just as well, given that the mechanism in question is no longer
    part of libwireshark, but is part of libwsutil.
    
    This should fix bug 9508.

    CAN protocols have a CAN ID and up to 8 bytes of data.  How the CAN ID and data are presented is the responsibility of the previous layer.  Make the interface be passing the CAN ID in dissector data and have the (up to) 8 bytes be the tvb.  CAN protocols should treat the CAN ID as "generated" data.

commit 5c40dde
Author: Anders Broman <anders.broman@ericsson.com>
Date:   Wed Dec 4 20:55:52 2013 +0000

    "RFC 6733 [5] specifies the Experimental-Result AVP containing Vendor-Id AVP and Experimental-Result-Code AVP. The Experimental-Result-Code AVP (AVP Code 298) is of type Unsigned32 and contains a vendor-assigned value representing the result of processing a request."
    
    This means we have to store the value of the Vendor Id AVP in the grouped  Experimental-Result AVP to be able to dissect the value of
    Experimental-Result-Code according to the vendor specified values(if known). This patch implements that with a dissector table to register vendor dissectors for the result code.

    From Michal Labedzki via https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9446 - r53051 introduced an incorrect DISSECTOR_ASSERT(acl_data), which led me to believe that acl_data must not be NULL.  Except for the removal of the DISSECTOR_ASSERT(acl_data), this patch basically reverts r53735 and r53743, as acl_data can be NULL.

    - The plugins are not searched for in the current directory,
      so find out how to let Wireshark know to search for the
      plugins
    - Other supporting files are missing (COPYING.txt, AUTHORS*, ...)
    - Your missing feature could be listed here ;)

Date:   Sat Nov 30 15:42:14 2013 +0000

    Add G.722, G.726 and SBC codecs.  G.722 and G.726 are from bug 5619 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5619) and SBC is from bug 7893 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=7893).
    
    Codecs are added, but (intentionally) not hooked to the RTP player as a "more generic architecture" is desired.  There are some discussions in bug 7893 on how to do this.  One thing to add would be how to handle codecs that may not be supported on all platforms.  Should the codec not be "registered" at all (with a #define over the whole module) or should it's register functions be stubbed (with a #define in each function that requires a non-supported library)

Date:   Fri Nov 29 23:52:32 2013 +0000

    When a snaplength isn't specifically set by the user, the default snaplength is used.  In this case, rather than display the text, "default", display the actual value so the user always knows which value will be used.  Other tools (tcpdump, for example) uses a different default snaplength, so it may not have been obvious to all users which value Wireshark uses for its default snaplength (even if it is documented in the man pages).

    Stats_tree enhancements for sorting, averages and burst rate.  Bug 9452 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9452)
    
    From Deon van der Westhuysen
    
    - Bug fix: object leak in stats_tree after a tap reset (for example apply statistics preferences with a stats_tree window open)
    - Bug fix: correct sample code in README.stats_tree
    - Add: slash in plug-in name now creates submenu as docs describe (was a bug?)
    - Add: menu separator before the stat_tree registered plug-ins
    - Add: stats_tree can now calculate averages for nodes; automatically calculated for range nodes. Add section in README.stats_tree describing averages.
    - Add: stats_tree can now calculate burst rate of each node (like rate but with a shorter, sliding time window)
    - Add: sorting for stats_tree plug-ins. Can sort on node name, count, average, min, max values and burst rate.
    - Add: preferences for stats_tree system (default sort column, burst calc params)
    - Add: stats_tree window copy to clipboard and export and plain text, csv and XML.
    - Added sample of new functionality in $srcdir/plugins/stats_tree/pinfo_stats_tree.c
    - Moved all stats_tree sample plug-ins to "IP Statistics" submenu.

    I've now got tshark to build from a VS solution file, had to do some hacks
    to get there though, patch files attached for others to peruse, as I'm not
    sure if they are the optimal solutions:
    
       3. As mentioned in my previous message, the VS solution chops out every
       8192nd byte from the command line passed to make-dissector-reg.py.  My
       patch (make-reg.patch) gets CMake to write out the required source file
       list to a file and modifies the python script to read in the file.  The
       python changes *should* be backwards compatible.

    GUINT_TO_POINTER() does just enough casting to suppress complaints about
    32-bit integers and 64-bit pointers, so it needs to be handed a guint
    (or equivalent type); it doesn't suppress warnings about 8-bit or 16-bit
    integers, so those have to be cast up to guint first.

    3. Bluetooth: HFP: Fix unexpected expert info

    Bugfix Negative Fibre Channel scsi_time value.  Bug 3209 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3209)
    
    The solution was to move the itlq_nexus_t structure handling from the FC dissector to the FCS dissector since it's actually the one with the LUN field.  OXID+LUN makes a unique exchange at FC layer so track that separately.  Also needed some additional OXID->LUN mapping at the FC layer to keep LUN correctly persistent.
    
    Not backporting because this was partially made possible by r53569, which won't be backported.

    - Create/use several extended value_strings

    - Use new VALUE_STRING_LIST mechanism/macros to
      create enums and value_string arrays for:
        WERR_errors, DOS_errors, SRV_errors, and HRD_errors;
    
    - Declare certain global value_string arrays as static (local)
      and use global extended value_strings to reference same;
        (e.g., ms_coiuntry_codes value_string_array)
    
    - Rename SMBE_... defs used in several different value_string arrays
      to prevent potential name collisions:
       ( e.g., for SRV_errors: SMBE_... ==> SMBE_SRV_...)
       Done for value_string arrays: DOS_errors, SRV_errors, HRD_errors;
    
    - WERR_errors value_string array:
        Note that WERR associated defs no longer exist in the latest samba doserr.h.
        (The WERR_errors defs were originally generated from the samba doserr.h).
        For now: WERR_errors kept as is.

commit 69017ac
Author: Jeff Morriss <jeff.morriss.ws@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Nov 26 23:43:18 2013 +0000

    Overhaul rpm-building options a bit: as suggested by Anders, have the RPM follow
    ./configure's options for gtk2 vs gtk3 vs qt.
    
    Make it possible to not build the GNOME package (now both UIs' packages are
    optional).  I think Chris requested this a while ago.
    
    If this works out it may make sense to control the rest of the options via
    ./configure .

    Actually, you can set the link-layer header type globally from the
    command line, and it works as long as all interfaces on which you're
    capturing support it and that's what you really want.
    
    There's some UI cleanup that calls for, however.

commit 2c9ea8a
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Nov 25 21:21:25 2013 +0000

    If we don't have any preference set for the link-layer header type for
    an interface, don't destroy the default link-layer header type from the
    list of types.
    
    I.e., first get the type from the preference (which sets the type to -1
    if there isn't a preference), and then loop through the list of types
    and, if there was no value obtained from the preference (i.e., the type
    is -1), set it to the first type in the list.
    
    Also, don't bother with the link-layer header type from the global
    default options, as a global (all-interface) link-layer header type
    makes little sense, given that the list of link-layer header types for
    an interface depends on the type of interface and hence may differ from
    interface to interface.
    
    Fixes bug 9473.

commit 4dbed5f
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sun Nov 24 22:51:44 2013 +0000

    According to
    
        http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.8.2/gcc/Code-Gen-Options.html#Code-Gen-Options
    
    -ftrapv "generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction,
    multiplication operations." and -fwrapv "instructs the compiler to
    assume that signed arithmetic overflow of addition, subtraction and
    multiplication wraps around using twos-complement representation."
    
    Those seem mutually-exclusive to me, and we probably want wrapping, not
    traps, as there's probably a fair bit of code out there that explicitly
    or implicitly assumes wrapping.  (Actually, we really want to avoid
    signed arithmetic for the cases that most matter, such as offsets and
    lengths, but, unfortunately, we currently have API conventions that
    allow negative values for lengths, either with -1 meaning "to the end"
    or with negative values meaning "relative to the end".)  In addition,
    there seem to be some bugs complaining that -ftrapv doesn't always cause
    traps on signed integer overflow.
    
    We seem to be seeing crashes in Lemon on the Solaris buildbot subsequent
    to adding -ftrapv; I don't know whether that's an overflow being
    detected, a bug in the compiler, or something unrelated, especially
    given that we're using Sun C, not GCC, on the Solaris buildbot.
    However, we'll try removing -ftrapv, to see if it fixes the problem; the
    MIT CSAIL paper in question wasn't really recommending all the GCC
    options it mentioned (which, as noted, wouldn't make sense, as -ftrapv
    and -fwrapv appear to be mutually-exclusive).

    pidl would tag all pinfo arguments as unused, as it doesn't take the

    doing so - might as well just flag them preemptively).
    
    pidl can't handle this, at least not on OS X, as it's not handling the
    C++/C99-style dissectors in the IDL for NSPI, so we manually put the
    _U_s back.

    Actually, the "1632" types do exist, and are 16-bit for NDR and 32-bit
    for NDR64, and we handle them.  The real problems are elsewhere.

    Get rid of trailing spaces, fix some proto_tree_add_item() calls as per
    the result of pidl on dce.idl.
    
    (We can't just regenerate it, as there are some pidl bugs that cause bad

    Updates to:
    
    	suggest using our version of pidl, given that its Wireshark
    	parser generator has changes to support the current internal
    	Wireshark APIs for dissectors;
    
    	suggest using "--includedir ." to make IDL files in
    	subdirectories of epan/dissectors/pidl work;
    
    	update the list of IDL files with issues;
    
    	reformat to 80x66 (if it's good enough for Herman Hollerith,
    	it's good enough for me!).

Date:   Sun Nov 24 01:32:55 2013 +0000

    Some patches from Peter Harris to make it possible to build the X11 dissector
    again (and some various other improvements):
    
    Rebuild the dissector with the latest xcbproto and mesa.
    
    
    Subject: [PATCH 01/11] X11 dissector: Support CARD64 and INT64 types
    These types are used by the new Present extension.
    
    Subject: [PATCH 02/11] X11 dissector: Un-blacklist a few structures
    The xinput structs are used by the latest xcb/proto, and the xkb
    struct has been removed.
    
    Subject: [PATCH 03/11] X11 dissector: Add hack for xinput:ChangeProperty
    xinput:ChangeProperty should use switch/case, but only switch/bitcase
    is supported at the moment. Add (hopefully temporary) hack.
    
    Subject: [PATCH 04/11] X11 dissector: Use namespace for types
    In particular, the name of the xsync struct 'INT64' collides with a
    basic type of the same name.
    
    Subject: [PATCH 05/11] X11 dissector: Add support for "Generic" events
    All new extensions are using the new "Generic" events instead of
    traditional events, because there aren't enough traditional event
    numbers.
    
    Denoted by <event xge="true"> in xcb/proto.
    
    Subject: [PATCH 06/11] X11 dissector: Blacklist unused structures
    
    Subject: [PATCH 07/11] X11 dissector: Support multiple enumref in a bitcase
    XKB is weird.
    
    Subject: [PATCH 08/11] X11 dissector: Support sumof
    
    Subject: [PATCH 09/11] X11 dissector: Stop generating unused-but-set variables

commit a18cf19
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sat Nov 23 19:51:02 2013 +0000

    Always check cf->edt before dereferencing it, so that Coverity doesn't
    say "you checked it here, but you dereferenced it later even if it was
    null when you checked it".
    
    This obviates the need for some checks of frame_selected, as cf->edt
    will be non-null iff cf->current_frame is non-null.
    
    Always check *cf, not cfile, in set_menus_for_selected_packet().
    Currently, cf always == &cfile, but we aren't guaranteeing that will be
    true forever.

commit 9b7fb8a
Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Sat Nov 23 02:20:13 2013 +0000

    Create the ability to have packet scoped "proto" data.  Bug 9470 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9470)
    
    I'm not sold on the name or module the proto_data functions live in, but I believe the function arguments are solid and gives us the most flexibility for the future.  And search/replace of a function name is easy enough to do.
    
    The big driving force for getting this in sooner rather than later is the saved memory on ethernet packets (and IP packets soon), that used to have file_scope() proto data when all it needed was packet_scope() data (technically packet_info->pool scoped), strictly for Decode As.
    
    All dissectors that use p_add_proto_data() only for Decode As functionality have been converted to using packet_scope().  All other dissectors were converted to using file_scope() which was the original scope for "proto" data.

    packetSelectionChanged and use it to trigger menu updates in the main

    Remove packet_info->ipproto and packet_info->ethertype uses in the GUI.  Convert to walking packet protocol list looking for desired protocols.
    
    I may eventually switch this to use proto_* values instead of strings, but just the addition of the loop is more jarring as compared to the simple comparing of ip or ethernet values.  But it should lead to a smaller (less protocol specific) packet_info structure.

    Add support for a new type of frame data record seen in a k18 file, and
    handle that file not ending with a 2-byte 0xffff end-of-file record.
    
    This fixes bug 9455, although it doesn't add support for reading an
    "index" file for a capture that's in multiple .rf5 files, which is a
    separate issue noted in that bug.
    
    It also doesn't attempt to figure out what the data in the new record
    type following the data that appears to be the same as that in the other
    data record format but preceding the actual packet data is.

commit 7d2ae28
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Wed Nov 20 20:17:33 2013 +0000

    Add code to dump part of a record as ASCII, and use it to dump strings
    in a source description record, including the stack.  Dump some other
    fields in those records as well.
    
    Attach separate sequential and random read buffers to the private data
    structure, rather than allocating them in various routines (and not
    always freeing them) and, in at least one case, allocating a single
    *common* buffer for all wth's to use.
    
    Fix some comments (the DS0 mask is 32 bytes long, but gets turned into a
    bitmask).
    
    Put in a description of what a "stack file"'s contents look like.  Much
    of it may be useless to us (for example, we have the notion that TCP has
    protocol number 6 built-in...), but the RELATION entries that map from
    "BASE" to a protocol could obviate the need to have the user specify a
    map from stack file names to starting protocols, and we might be able to
    use, for example, entries that map TCP/UDP/SCTP port numbers to
    protocols to obviate the need for the user to explicitly use Decode As
    or otherwise configure port-to-protocol mappings themselves.
    
    Add a bunch of record length checks before we fetch data from records.

    Provide "Decode As" functionality through dissectors themselves instead of the GUI.  Bug 9450 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9450)
    
    The basic idea behind this design is to have dissectors register with a "decode as list" with their name and dissector table.  When "Decode As" dialog is launched, any "registered" dissector found in the packet will cause a tab to be created in the dialog.  Any GUI (GTK+/Qt/tshark) can just hook into the "decode as list" to see what can be provided.
    
    This patch includes the GUI portion of the functionality (including packet-dcerpc.[ch] because it had some GUI dependencies that are now removed).
    
    Other notes:
    1. Some "GUI text" (UTF8_LEFTWARDS_ARROW and similar) made their way into the dissector code.  Not sure how necessary it is and if reformatting the strings to avoid the macros is desired (TCP/UDP use it, SCTP doesn't).
    
    2. I converted the SCTP functionality to have 2 tabs (instead of radio button), currently both are labeled "Transport" which could be confusing to users.  Naming suggestions welcome (as well as for naming of tabs from other dissectors).
    
    3. BER and DCERPC have more opportunity to use Decode As now that they are selected based on dissector presense, not packet_info values.
    
    4. Catapult DCT2000 populates pinfo->ipproto, yet under new design will not show up to do Decode As.  Should a "decode as item" be created for it?
    
    5. BER dissector doesn't have Clear/Show Current functionality working (never did)
    
    6. Bluetooth (in old design) could have been used "capture wide" instead of single packet (creating tabs of values not present in current packet), which goes against what I believe to be in the intent of Decode As, but I'm willing to hear counter-arguments.

    Convert ethertype() function into a pure dissector.  Bug 9454 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9454)
    
    The main driving force for this was my new Decode As functionality (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9450) that wants a dissector/subdissector table relationship for all dissectors wanting to use Decode As functionality.  The ethertype() function provides the value to the "ethertype" subdissector table, so I think it should be matched to a dissector.  Only odd side effect is the display filter of "ethertype" returns no packets because there is no "item" associated with the dissector.

commit 45fc7b6
Author: Gerald Combs <gerald@wireshark.org>
Date:   Mon Nov 18 23:39:47 2013 +0000

    Follow dialog data display improvements.
    
    Change the "Raw" character type to UTF-8. I'm not sure it's possible
    to show true raw data in a QTextEdit widget and calling it UTF-8 more
    accurately repesents what happens when you pass a char * to a QString.
    Add a YAML display. Hopefully Scapy users will find it useful.
    
    Sort the the character display items alphabetically. Make sure we go
    back to the top of the buffer when we change the direction or character
    set. Be less aggressive about setting focus on the "find text" entry.

commit 123e3d9
Author: Alexis La Goutte <alexis.lagoutte@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 18 20:26:55 2013 +0000

    From Peter Wu
    
    Add status_request_v2 TLS extension dissection (RFC6961)
    
    Besides adding status_request_v2 support, this patch moves the
    Certificate Status Type from the OCSP Status subtree to its parent
    (the extension tree). This is needed because this type applies to all
    OCSPResponse fields.
    
    The check for "tree != NULL" seems unnecessary here, it was not
    clarified in the original patch so I removed it.

commit 954584d
Author: Alexis La Goutte <alexis.lagoutte@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 18 20:26:46 2013 +0000

    From Peter Wu
    
    Add TLS StatusRequest (RFC6066) ClientHello extension recognition
    
    Only empty Responder ID lists and empty Request Extensions are
    implemented. I could not really find existing clients or servers that
    populate these.
    
    This status_request extension has a different signature for a
    ClientHello and ServerHello, in the latter the extension_data field
    must be empty. Therefore an additional parameter is added to
    dissect_ssl3_hnd_hello_ext.

commit 409dd07
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Nov 12 22:06:00 2013 +0000

    Replace fvalue_ftype() with a fvalue_type_ftenum() routine that returns
    the ftenum_t for the fvalue's ftype, rather than a pointer to the ftype
    (which isn't all that useful except as a handle, unless you import the
    internal header).
    
    Have fvalue_to_string_repr() return NULL, rather than failing, if the
    fvalue's ftype has no val_to_string_repr method.
    
    This lets us not include the ftypes internal header in
    ui/cli/tap-diameter-avp.c.

    Fix permissions for installed OS X files and directories.
    
    Add a cli-preinstall script that creates missing parts of the
    installation path and sets their permissions. Simply copy
    "utility-launcher" to "wireshark" instead of renaming it at install
    time. Explicitly set its ownership and permissions. Pretty-print some of
    the PackageMaker XML files via `xmllint --format --recover`.

    Have rpc_call_info_value be passed through to (sub)dissectors instead of using pinfo->private_data.
    
    This was acheived by adding a void* data parameter to the dissect_function_t typedef in packet-rpc.h (r53213).  After converting the pinfo->private_data, I'm not sure if it would be better to change the void* data pointer to be a rpc_call_info_value* explicitly. Not all "dissector functions" use it, but it would certainly save a lot of casting...

    Add data parameter to dissect_function_t in vsff structure.  The intention here is to use it to replace some pinfo->private_data.
    
    I didn't realize how expansive this change would be, so committing it now before replacing the pinfo->private_data, so if something needs to be reverted, all of this is not lost.

    More packaging updates.
    
    Specify "Application" or "Installer" code signing identities as needed.
    Switch back to productbuild for the package. That seems to be the
    correct utility to use. Give the package an ID. Package signing is still
    broken but this appears to be closer to being correct.

commit 8081cf1
Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Sat Nov 9 17:46:28 2013 +0000

    Add data parameter to tcp_dissect_pdus() as well as convert it to using "new" style dissectors.
    
    Now that "bytes consumed" can be determined, should tcp_dissect_pdus() take advantage of that?
    
    Should tcp_dissect_pdus return length (bytes consumed)?  There are many dissectors that just call tcp_dissect_pdus() then return tvb_length(tvb).  Seems like that could all be rolled into one.

Author: Jörg Mayer <jmayer@loplof.de>
Date:   Thu Nov 7 21:40:31 2013 +0000

    Remove extraction of cmake parameters from autotools files.
    While it was an interesting exercise it just doesn't
    work good enough to stay, i.e. it doesn't automatically
    pick up changes but requires rerunning cmake instead.

    Have the gsm_rlcmac_ul and gsm_rlcmac_dl use the data parameter of the dissector function instead of pinfo->private_data to receive a RlcMacPrivateData_t structure.
    
    This work was done in bug 7615 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=7615), but the tie in to use the RlcMacPrivateData_t structure (passed by the GSMTAP dissector) was never completed.

    All "generated" source was manually modified (with the power of search/replace), but I believe the "source input" files have been adjusted (checked into revs 53098 and 53099) to reflect the necessary changes (with possible whitespace formatting differences).
    
    The Microsoft compiler doesn't flag "unused function parameters", so I apologize in advance if I may have missed a few.  The "dcerpc_info* di" parameter is used in almost every function.

Date:   Tue Nov 5 18:47:26 2013 +0000

    In an effort to reduce the use of pinfo->private_data (and some true global variables), I converted the ASN.1 dissectors that use pinfo->private_data to exchange a SESSION_DATA_STRUCTURE to instead only exchange it in the context of ASN.1.  This meant converting dissectors to the "new" style to pass the SESSION_DATA_STRUCTURE as well as providing a pointer to it in asn1_ctx_t.private_data.  Yes, it's still "private data", but it's not used by all dissectors like pinfo->private data is.

    Replace pinfo->layer_names as a string with pinfo->layers as a wmem_list of
    protocol IDs. This is substantially more efficient, which means we can build it
    all the time rather than only if tree (in my benchmarks the extra time taken is
    not large enough to be statistically significant even over tens of thousands of
    packets).
    
    This fixes what was probably a bug in btobex that relied on layer_names for
    non-tree dissection. It also enables a much simpler fix for

commit de05747
Author: Jörg Mayer <jmayer@loplof.de>
Date:   Mon Nov 4 20:29:29 2013 +0000

    - Reenable /LARGEADDRESSAWARE on Windows platform
    - Add a CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE default of RelWithDebInfo (Release with debug info),
      print the choice.
      This will pick up the previously used flags LINK_FLAGS and
      CMAKE_C_FLAGS and CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS but also pick up the variables postfixed
      by _<build-type>
    - Remove Optimization (-O2) and debug (-g) flags from list of default flags
      as they are now automagically set by CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO etc.
      NOTE: This also needs to be done for the Windows flags, I just don't have
      a Win system to test on right now.

    Effectively remove the tree memory pool and port some of its behaviour to the

    ieee80211: Decode Radio Measurements (Action Frames)
    
    The length of the fixed fields are dependent on the radio measurement
    action. Before this patch, fields following the action code were
    ignored, leading to wrong decoding results. This patch adds recognition
    for the Radio Measurement action management frames as specified in
    IEEE Std 802.11-2012.
    
    From me:
    * Rename some hf (Add ff_ in name)
    * Link Margin and Transmit Power are signed
    * Use always proto_tree_add_item (replace proto_tree_add_text)

    General dissector cleanup.

commit c0fcebb
Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Thu Oct 31 00:57:03 2013 +0000

    Add a data parameter to call_ber_oid_callback to be able to pass data to subdissectors found with dissector_try_string_new.
    
    The intention is to aid in the removal of pinfo->private_data use as well as static global variables in a dissector.  For now, all calls to call_ber_oid_callback have the data parameter set to NULL.

commit 9075922
Author: Gerald Combs <gerald@wireshark.org>
Date:   Wed Oct 30 22:39:52 2013 +0000

    Add initial support for geometry settings in the main window.
    
    In the current Qt startup sequence the main window + splash screen is
    displayed before the main preferences are loaded which means we can't
    immediately apply the correct geometry. For now, use an animation to
    morph from the default to the saved geometry after the prefs are loaded.
    
    Get rid of main_do_quit() (Qt) and main_window_exit() (Qt+GTK). It looks
    like they were unused.
    
    Add wsApp->isInitialized() and use it to see if we should exit() when
    the main window is closed. Otherwise we won't shut the application down
    and clean up properly.

commit a364873
Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Oct 30 02:09:34 2013 +0000

    Replace some proto_tree_add_string_format with proto_tree_add_item +
    proto_tree_set_text - the string was not the important part, the formatting was.
    We were passing the string directly from tvb_get_ptr, but this meant that if the
    packet didn't contain a null-terminator we would run off the end. Since the
    string comes straight from the packet, just let _add_item handle the length
    calculations etc efficiently, and set the display later.
    
    Fixes https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9323
    
    I'm a bit confused honestly why most of these are being set hidden after being
    added and formatted, but at least there are no memory errors anymore.

    From didier gautheron: remove redundant or use faster col_xxx functions
    
    - when the text parameter is constant col_add_str() and col_set_str() are equivalent but col_set_str() is faster.
    - same for  replace col_append_fstr and col_append_str
    - remove col_clear() when it's redundant:
        + before a col_set/col_add if the dissector can't throw an exception.
    - replace col_append() after a col_clear() with faster col_add... or col_set

Author: Jeff Morriss <jeff.morriss.ws@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 29 02:28:16 2013 +0000

    Make it so out-of-tree builds (autofoo and cmake) have access to the various
    data files (diameter/*, COPYING, manuf) when running *shark from the
    build directory.
    
    Do this by passing in the top-level source directory as a compile-time
    definition (unfortunately this has to be in the top-level Makefile too because
    some programs link directly with epan/filesystem.c).
    
    The plugins dir is no longer below the datafile directory but rather the
    progfile directory (if we have one).  Handle the special case of AUTHORS-SHORT
    (a data file but a generated one) by checking the file name before building
    the path.

    Have GTPv2 pass its "instance ID" to "private extension" subdissectors rather than use pinfo->private_data.  There are no "private extension" subdissectors in the Wireshark source, so I assume it's all done by third-party plugins.  They must now update their dissectors to get the "instance ID" from the dissector data parameter.

    From Ishraq Ibne Ashraf: Tinkerforge protocol dissector
    
    See: https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9324
    
    From me:
    
    1. Move certain global vars to local storage in dissect_tfp_common()
    
    2. Declare all remaining global vars as static;
    
    3. Fix some bugs:
        - base58_encode() needed to be called before call to col_add_fstr()
        - display of UID string in tree was being truncated to 4 characters
    
    4. Cleanup whitespace: use consistent indentation (tabs); remove trailing whitespace;
    
    5. Add editor modelines

Date:   Mon Oct 28 18:01:09 2013 +0000

    From Peter Wu via https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9341 :
    
    SVN rev 50525 tried to fix out-of-source-tree builds, but did so by
    writing the .rcc.cpp files to the source tree. This was noticed when
    running `make distcheck`. This patch reverts that behavior, and creates
    the image/ directory to fix out-of-tree builds.
    
    In other words, fix things so "make distcheck" with Qt works in out-of-tree
    builds too.

    Pass tcap_private into the dissectors that need it rather than use private_data.  Not sure if value_ptr is the "proper" place to pass tcap_private "internally" within the TCAP dissector, but it gets away from (potential) private_data (ab)use.

Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Sun Oct 27 23:18:19 2013 +0000

    Remove "Cisco MDS-specific" fields from packet_info.  2 of the 3 fields were used strictly for columns that are considered "deprecated" and I think the third could be put in that category as well.
    
    I assume the column enumerations haven't already been removed because of legacy "indexing issues", but if I'm wrong, we should definitely remove the columns altogether.  Could also see renaming columns to DEPRECATED_[X].

    Updates to radiotap-iter licensing terms. The upstream version has a COPYING
    file containing what is actually the ISC license (BSD-like), so add that to the
    header for licensecheck's sake (and remove the confusing reference to the BSD
    license). This makes the code actually your choice of ISC
    and GPL2 (since it is used in the Linux kernel which is GPL2-only). ISC is
    already acceptable for us, so ISC \union * must be also, so add ISC+GPL2 to
    checlicenses' list.
    
    Upstream COPYING file, for reference:
    http://git.sipsolutions.net/?p=radiotap.git;a=blob;f=COPYING;hb=97478c8467ce7ab56b7c9e8fd7cdc0f4e2cb22ed

    Bluetooth: Use items for logical block objects.  Bug 9327 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9327)
    
    Bluetooth protocols use items, so dissect it to improve filtering and better user experience - text object cannot be filterable or comparable.

commit 95f484a
Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Oct 25 22:14:25 2013 +0000

    Add a very small hack to make the UAT update callback error string freeable, and
    convert all existing UAT update callbacks to use glib memory instead of
    ephemeral memory for that string.
    
    UAT code paths are entirely distinct from packet dissection, so using ephemeral
    memory was the wrong choice, because there was no guarantees about when it would
    be freed.
    
    The move away from emem still needs to be propogated deeper into the UAT code
    itself at some point.
    
    Net effect: remove another bunch of emem calls from dissectors, where replacing
    with wmem would have caused assertions.

    Fix CID 1111806: it's not safe to check if "tag < sizeof(tag_to_type)" before
    accessing tag_to_type[tag]: while the array is made of enums and the values of
    the enum will fit in a guint8 (making the conditional safe) compilers don't
    *have* to "right size" the storage for the enum.  They very well could be lazy
    and store the enum in int's.
    
    Replace it with a macro that tells us the size of the array.

    Change cflow.sysuptime from an FT_UINT32 (milliseconds since the router booted)
    to an FT_RELATIVE_TIME (seconds since the router booted).  I don't imagine
    anyone will care if we show them seconds or milliseconds and it satisfy the
    user's request (in that bug) to compare cflow.sysuptime to cflow.timeend (which
    is already an FT_RELATIVE_TIME).
    
    (If someone does care, we could always display the field twice, once in
    milliseconds and once in seconds.)

    Bugfix "Restart the running live capture" when using multiple files makes a long filename.  Bug 2274 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2274)
    
    Yes this solution leaks memory, but I think the handful of bytes leaked is worth fixing this nuisance.  Won't backport until leak is fixed though.

    First cut at having this handle Qt.  Adds a TOOLKIT variable that you
    set to "qt", "gtk2", or "gtk3".
    
    Work done on a machine with the command-line build tools, but not Full
    Frontal Xcode, installed, so it couldn't build Qt, so it hasn't been
    tested.  It *has* been fixed to complain in that case, rather than
    letting the Qt build fail with a somewhat less useful message talking
    about Xcode licensing.

    Add support for dissection ELF files. It opens as a "capture" file via wiretap

    much of the libwireshark infrastructure.

    Cannot define Field refering ProtoField defined in LUA. Bug 3513 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3513)
    
    When a new Field is created, does as following:
    
    * Check whether that field is registered, by using `proto_registrar_get_byname`. This is current behavior.
    * (patched) If not registered, check whether that field is defined in LUA and will be registered. This is performed in `wslua_is_field_available` accessing LUA context.
    * If not, an error "a field with this name must exist"  occurs.

    Optimization: in test_length there's no need to validate that the count value
    for FT_UINT_STRINGs and FT_UINT_BYTEs is still in the TVB. Any infinite loop
    that adds a counted field ought to be extracting the length for its own offset
    anyways, in which case it will overflow on the next iteration and won't actually
    loop forever.

commit a7fbfd7
Author: Bill Meier <wmeier@newsguy.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 22 14:27:48 2013 +0000

    Cleanup:
    - remove duplicate/unneeded #includes
    - remove some boilerplate comments
    - fix up whitespace: indentation, trailing & etc
    - remove 'if (tree)'
      (Note: 'if (tree)' needs to be around all the code (as in the previous
              version of packet-wsmp) or none so that the same value of offset is used
              in various function calls whether or not 'tree == NULL'.
             For the moment I've chosen to remove the 'if (tree)' since (in theory)
             the (external) data dissector shouldn't be called under 'if (tree)'.
    - revert SVN #52757 since no it's longer needed with the removal of 'if (tree)';
    - remove another unneeded line of code.

Author: Jakub Zawadzki <darkjames-ws@darkjames.pl>
Date:   Sun Oct 20 19:05:00 2013 +0000

    2nd try to fix recent test failures.
    
    After recent changes it's possible that epan_dissect_cleanup() can be called if there were
    no dissection run on it (epan_dissect_run()) In such case ->tvb will have random value,
    just initialize it to NULL in _init() and see if it's working.
    
    Thanks goes to Evan for backtrace.

commit 107e4a6
Author: Jakub Zawadzki <darkjames-ws@darkjames.pl>
Date:   Sun Oct 20 10:11:16 2013 +0000

    Move resetting packet_info structure from dissect_packet() to epan_dissect_init()
    
    It'd be actually good idea to seperate packet_info data (packet.c) from epan_dissect_t (epan.c),
    but this rule is already violated.
    
    Strict seperation could allow for example allow multiple dissection on the same epan_dissect_t
    (I think it was idea behind it), but it's not working.

commit 1f35491
Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Oct 19 19:40:02 2013 +0000

    Don't link explicitly with libwmem, it's already in libwireshark and the symbol
    doubling leads to all sorts of very subtle badness (including test failures due
    to funny internal assertions because the two wmems have mismatching state).
    
    Make wmem_init and wmem_cleanup PUBLIC instead of LOCAL so that they don't get
    stripped and don't cause a link failure when trying to build oids_test (now that
    it's not linking with libwmem explicitly). There is possibly a better way to fix
    this, but I'm not sure what it is.

Date:   Sat Oct 19 02:45:01 2013 +0000

    Only allow one popup dialog in UAT dialog.  Editing/copying/deleting can modify the uat list and other open dialogs will not be aware of it and lead to unexpected behavior (including crashes).  Fixes bug 9129 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9129)

    Don't allow invalid ranges to be specified for the stats tree. Bug 9130 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9130)
    
    Not sure which memory allocation should be used here (using wmem caused crash), but this revision can at least be easily backported to 1.10 where the bug was reported.
    
    Also allow a single number to be used in the stats range since it's considered a valid "range" by the UAT.

commit f6e09fa
Author: Bill Meier <wmeier@newsguy.com>
Date:   Wed Oct 16 00:57:28 2013 +0000

    From Ed Beroset: add modelines and fix irregular indenting;
    
    https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9273
    
    This patch adds modelines and cleans up the irregular indentation of
    this dissector's code.  The only other change was in
    asn1/c1222/packet-c1222-template.c to consolidate an #ifdef that had a
    redundant #endif (line 812) and subsequent reopening #ifdef (line
    824).  The only thing between them was comments, so the span of the
    original #ifdef (line 644) was simply extended by eliminating those
    two lines.
    
    The purpose for this patch is to make the file easier to edit and
    understand in advance of more substantive patches later.  This patch
    is intended to be easy to review by having only non-substantive
    changes.

Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>

    As suggested separately by both Jakub and Anders: only read the
    WIRESHARK_DEBUG_WMEM_OVERRIDE environment variable once in wmem_init, not every
    time wmem_allocator_new is called. We currently create a new pinfo pool for
    every packet we dissect, so this is a small performance win, especially when
    getenv is slow (which may happen if a large number of environment variables are
    set, such as when fuzz-testing).

    Reorder all of the bitmask trees according to its endianess from highest to lowest order bit.

    [packet-smb2.c] 'Flags', 'Session Flags', 'Security mode', and 'Interface Capabilities'.
    
    [packet-smb.c] Made the tfs_file_attribute_xxx true_false_string values less verbose and more compact.
    
    [packet-smb2.c] Changed all references to "RMDA" to RDMA".
    
    [packet_smb.c] In dissect_qfi_SMB_FILE_NETWORK_OPEN_INFO() (GetInfo response) changed "Unknown Field"

    limit the values written to phdr.(cap)len to guint32, not to guint16
    
    We read a two-byte length field and add a constant number of header
    bytes to this length, so we could in theory be larger than guint16.

Date:   Sun Oct 13 20:19:30 2013 +0000

    SMB2 SRT can be very inaccurate in the presence of retransmissions:   Retransmitted responses not only add additional (bogus) transactions but also the latency associated with them. This can greatly inflate the maximum and average SRT stats especially in the case of retransmissions triggered by the expiry of the rexmit timer (RTOs). Only calculating SRT for the first response received accomplishes this goal without requiring the TCP pref "Do not call subdissectors for error packets" to be set.

commit efdbb59
Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Oct 13 04:54:14 2013 +0000

    So a while back Jeff added some code to check that the offset+length passed to
    proto_tree_add_item was valid *before* we short-circuited based on a NULL tree.
    This was good in that it removed a common source of really-long-loop bugs. It
    was less good in that it cost us about 8% in speed when doing a tree-less
    dissection, but we decided the tradeoff was worth it.
    
    After Anders' recent mail to -dev about performance, I started thinking about
    how to optimize this. It occurred to me that the vast majority of the logic
    involved in the check was dealing with the length value - fetching the actual
    length if it was a counted string, calculating the length if it was -1, adding
    the length to the offset in a way that was free from overflows, etc.
    
    All of this is (theoretically) unnecessary - simply checking the offset without
    worrying about the length will still catch the very-long-loops, since it is the
    offset that increases in each iteration, not the length.
    
    All that to justify:
    - implement tvb_ensure_offset_exists which throws an exception if the offset is
      not within the tvb
    - use it instead of all the complicated other logic in the pre-short-circuit
      step of proto_tree_add_item and friends
    
    This gives us back about 3/4 of the performance we lost in the original patch.
    We're still ~2% slower than without any check, but this is the best I can think
    of right now.

Date:   Sat Oct 12 21:01:17 2013 +0000

    Redo r52569 in a way that doesn't break the GUI. Add a mem_pool member to
    tree_data and reference it directly when allocating/freeing tree items. This
    lets us keep multiple around when we need them, and still lets us use
    wmem_free_all for a major speedup. It also, coincidentally, lets us get rid of
    the annoying fi_tmp hack that was needed before, since that element gets swept
    up in the free_all with everything else.
    
    Keep one pool cached to avoid creating/destroying a pool for each packet,
    another minor performance win.
    
    The various changes in approach seem to balance out pretty much exactly, this
    still gives ~11% over pre-52569.

    Free the actual struct, not the typedef thereof, because the typedef is actually
    a typedef of a *pointer* to the struct, not the struct itself, which are
    different sizes.
    
    This doesn't show up under valgrind because the length isn't checked in that
    case, everything gets subsumed in valgrind's malloc/free hooks.

    Move the QT_MACEXTRAS_LIB cmakedefine in cmakeconfig.h.in to the

    Add some tests from the autoconf script to CMake:
    
    	check for setresgid() and setresuid();
    
    	check for struct stat having an st_flags member.
    
    Get rid of INTTYPES_H_DEFINES_FORMATS; we don't appear to check for it,
    and we don't use it (we're using GLib's formatting functions, which have
    their own way of handling 64-bit integers).
    
    Get rid of STDC_HEADERS; it's in autoconf because autoconf was
    originally developed back when you couldn't rely in ANSI C and has never
    been removed, and something we're using for other purposes checks for
    it, not because we explicitly test for it, but we don't test it in the
    code, and CMake doesn't even check for it.

    Fix2: "If (len==0) PROTO_ITEM_SET_GENERATED(item);" was added to dissect_nt_create_options_bits(), dissect_nt_share_access_bits(), dissect_smb_access_mask_bits(), dissect_nt_create_bits(), and dissect_file_ext_attr_bits().

    Fix the core dump reported in https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9258 :
    
    After calling wtap_close(), set the wth to NULL so we don't try to close it
    again later. (The core only happens when tshark isn't keeping up with dumpcap's
    file rotation.)
    
    Wireshark still has a problem but it's a different one.

    If the capture is frame sliced at or beyond the TCP 20-byte fixed length portion of the TCP header and tcp_analyze_seq is enabled, TCP analysis is not conducted:  As much of the options field as possible should be dissected and TCP analysis should be performed.
    Patch was tested with snaplens of:
    49 and 52:  (TCP fixed header incomplete) TCP analysis NOT performed.
    54:  (Fixed header complete but entire options wfield was sliced off) TCP analysis ran and was OK.
    64:  (Fixed header complete but a portion of the options field was missing) Options were dissected to the extent possible.  TCP analysis ran and was OK.
    66:  (Fixed header and options complete) TCP analysis ran and was OK.
    70:  (Fixed header and options complete plus  4 bytes) TCP analysis ran and was OK.

    Hacky fix for https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9248
    Just break out of the loop if offset doesn't go up.
    
    There's almost certainly a better fix - the dissector is weird, and I'm not sure
    if all the _length_remaining() checks are important or legacy, and what affect
    they have on this issue.
    
    At the very least this will pacify the fuzzbots until somebody has time to
    figure it out properly.

    Support running most tests out-of-tree. Use case is to have a source tree and
    use a semi-unprivileged user to perform tests (to rule out interference).
    
    From me:
    - fix unit-test suite, it has to build the binaries it runs so it must
      more-or-less ignore the out-of-tree stuff
    - fix name-res suite, just missing a path qualifier

    Make extra_split_ a member variable again. Make it and master_split_
    full-on values. Set various parent/child relationships at startup
    so that each widget is associated with a layout (which appears to be
    the actual fix).
    
    Make the throttled startup delay huge so that it's easier to browse
    using GammaRay.

Author: Martin Kaiser <wireshark@kaiser.cx>

    From Jacob Erlbeck
    
    Fix GPRS-NS protocol dissector for STATUS PDU
    
    When a NS-STATUS message contains a PDU, the packet description
    refers to the contained PDU and the offset is wrong, thus finding
    information elements that are not present.
    
    This fixes the implementation by checking, whether the PDU dissector
    has been called recursively and by updating the offset correctly.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>

    Rename epan/dissectors/packet-s5066.c to
    epan/dissectors/packet-s5066sis.c, to clarify that it's not for STANAG
    5066 as a whole, but just for the Subnetwork Interface Sublayer.
    There's currently an enhancement to support the Data Transport Sublayer,
    which adds a epan/dissectors/packet-s5066dts.c file.

Author: Alexis La Goutte <alexis.lagoutte@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 1 19:35:34 2013 +0000

    Enable RC2 support with libgcrypt
    
    The name "RC2" is not used by libgcrypt, instead it uses
    "RFC2268_<keysize>". RFC2268_40 and RFC2268_128 are both documented,
    though only RFC2268_40 is implemented right now.
    
    As documented in RFC2246 (TLS 1.0), section 6.3.1 Export key generation
    example, exportable ciphers (in this case, the
    TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC2_CBC_40_MD5 cipher) only use 40 bits of the
    key_block, but the real key (final_{client,server}_write_key) used for
    the actual algorithm (RC2) is still 16 bytes (128 bits). Therefore
    RFC2268_128 is the correct name to use.
    
    As libgcrypt 1.5.3 does not support the 128-bit keys, I have submitted a
    patch for libgcrypt to support the larger 128-bit rc2 keys has been
    submitted to gcrypt-devel@gnupg.org (it sits in their mail queue as I am
    not subscribed).

    Add some expert info.  The main reason for doing this was there were a bunch of proto_tree_add_bytes_format calls that were passing hf_ variables that weren't of type FT_BYTES, and I assume that should lead to a dissector assert/fuzzbot failure.
    
    For consistency all places that "didn't have enough bytes", got an expert message, regardless of whether the upcoming field itself was a FT_BYTES type.

    Convert some proto_tree_add_string_format calls to something more appropriate.
    
    There seem to be several cases of proto_tree_add_string_format where a "string" value/filter doesn't really make sense because it's always empty, and is just being used as a "filterable subtree header (placeholder)".  They appear to be more for "presense" than "value" and should probably be FT_NONE, although I'd almost argue for removing the filter in favor of  proto_tree_add_text.

    As pointed out in bug 9127, tcpdump dissects Juniper Attributes
    quite well - reimplement that in Wireshark.
    
    There is room for improvement in this patch, e.g. use subtrees for
    the subattributes.

    We always write to a FILE *, so:
    
    	make libpcap_write_to_file() static;
    
    	don't pass it as an argument to write routines, just have them
    	call it directly;
    
    	make the handle argument a FILE *.
    
    Make the data length argument to libpcap_write_to_file() a size_t, as
    that's what, for example, fwrite() takes as a size argument.

commit c1dd5d3
Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Sep 29 12:44:50 2013 +0000

    Replace some val_to_str calls with the equivalent val_to_str_const calls (and
    implement rval_to_str_const to do this). The format-strings didn't have any
    parameter specifiers in them, so they were clearly never used (or they would
    have blown up) but still a bug.
    
    This is one of the first steps towards converting val_to_str and friends to
    wmem. I'm honestly not sure what the best approach is for the API in this case:
    the vast majority of usage is within dissectors, so just hard-coding packet
    scope (the way they currently hard-code ep_ scope) doesn't look terrible, but
    there are *some* uses in taps and other places that will need to be converted to
    something else if we go that route. Adding a wmem_pool parameter just for the
    uncommon case seems a bit like overkill, though perhaps it is the right thing to
    do.

commit 640a45d
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sun Sep 29 00:37:04 2013 +0000

    Get rid of a redundant check - pcapng_read_packet_block() already checks
    whether the (zero-based) interface ID is < the number of interface IDs,
    so we don't need to do so in pcapng_read().
    
    Unions are tricky - if the compiler doesn't ensure that the right
    component of the union is being used at any given time, various problems
    can happen.
    
    Remove some members from the "data" union in the wtapng_block_t
    structure, and use a local variable of the specified type.

    In a Simple Packet Block, the captured length isn't the block length

    it's the minimum of that and the packet length, as there might be
    padding.

    While we're at it, pcapng_read_packet_block() and
    pcapng_read_simple_packet_block() return an integer, not a Boolean;
    return 0, not FALSE (they have the same value, but returning 0 makes it
    clearer that the return value isn't restricted to TRUE or FALSE).

    1. Remove PITEM_FINFO from add_tlv_subtree and add_protocol_subtree (as well as some other minor cleanup) and adjust the calling functions accordingly.
    
    2. Converted several add_protocol_subtree calls to add_tlv_subtree to get true filterability.  Many of the add_protocol_subtree are effectively being (ab)used as proto_tree_add_text with different highlighting.
    
    3. Convert tvb_new_subset into tvb_new_subset_length.
    
    Still looks like some of the remaining "protocols" need more specific filters, and should just be regular FT_BYTES fields.

    The welcome screen in the Qt port runs "dumpcap -S" to draw sparklines.
    On OS X this means that it holds open a BPF device for each interface.
    Trying to capture using another instance of Wireshark (or tcpdump, or

    Do all checks against the reported length; a packet that wasn't captured
    in its entirety due to a snapshot length being specified is not
    malformed.
    
    Instead of checking for the the sum of the offset and the value length
    being less than the offset, check whether the TLV length is <= 4 and, if
    so, just quit at that point (that also handles the "value is zero
    length" case).  That makes sure that valuelength isn't negative; given
    that length is < 65536, valuelength < 65532, so that won't cause offset
    to overflow, so that means offset won't go backwards.

commit f92832c
Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Tue Sep 24 21:06:05 2013 +0000

    Prevent crashing as a result of tree removal in r52208.  Tree removal + this patch should be the "quick" fix to bug 5349 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5349).  I knew the tree check was preventing some dissection/column data/etc, but from the comments in bug 5349, the tree check was also protecting this (and maybe other) crashes (due to missed NULL checking).
    
    I want to follow up with some massive cleanup (remove PITEM_FINFO calls), but this with r52208 should be good enough to backport to 1.8 and 1.10 to fix bug 5349.  Cleanup shouldn't need to be backported.

    You are in a twisty little maze of code paths, all different.  Get rid
    of the if (tree) tests in dissect_mac_header_generic_decoder(), as some
    of the stuff done inside there should be done even if we're not building
    a protocol tree, e.g. CRC stuff and calling subdissectors.
    
    Get rid of a gratuitous pair of curly braces, and fix the indentation of
    one line, while we're at it.

    One advantage of making as many things as possible static is that, if
    they're not being used, the compiler can be made to warn about that.
    
    In this case, Broadcast_Control_Pointer_IE() was used because of a
    missing case in a switch statement; put that case in.

commit 1ac3997
Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Tue Sep 24 18:45:39 2013 +0000

    Wimax dissector improvements:
    
    1. Remove message type field from all MAC Management "sub"dissectors and place it in Mac Management subdissector itself.  This may cause backwards-compatibility issues (malformed packets) with third-party subdissectors of the MAC Management dissector, but it didn't make sense to have so many filters for a single enumerated value, especially when the various "protocol" filters covers many of them.
    
    2. Removed some if(tree) checks as column info and calling other dissectors are sometimes executed underneath.  Some of this is in preparation for addressing bug 5349.
    
    3. Make all dissector functions (and a few others) static, and use register_dissector() when necessary.
    
    4. Convert generic decoder CRC errors into expert info, rather than have it be a "protocol" filter (it just looks funny that way)
    
    
    In general, these dissectors seem "over-protocolized". I understand the need for all of the dissectors, but I don't know if they all need "protocol" status.

      New: Creates HINTS for finding includes and libraries
      inside the Wireshark support library installation.
    - FindXXX.cmake
      Make use of HINTS generated by FindWSWinLibs.cmake
    
    This has not really been tested on Windows as my installation seems to have
    automagically downloaded some fixes and is in an inconsistent state since.

    From Peter Wu via https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9144 [PATCH] Update TLS Ciphers
    
    Really add support for AEAD ciphers (GCM)
    
    GCM uses counter mode with authentication tags (the latter is currently
    not supported). As for the key material, there is no MAC (because the
    auth tag is supposed to verify the authenticity).
    
    Finally, correct the GCM cipher suite definitions: IV block size of
    4 bytes and GCM instead of CBC mode.

commit a87da76
Author: Alexis La Goutte <alexis.lagoutte@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 19 20:27:05 2013 +0000

    From Peter Wu via https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9144 [PATCH] Update TLS Ciphers
    
    Use IV from record for CBC mode, add padding/IV length check
    
    Add summary of RFCs to make it more obvious why certain parts (IV, MAC,
    padding) are used. Merge DTLS and TLS blocks for extracting IV. This
    saves an unnecessary memmove() because the input pointer is, well, just
    a local variable and can therefore be incremented.
    
    Validate padding and IV lengths before using it. A crash could occur
    if the explicit IV is missing (this would make memmove write before its
    buffer). The missing padding check had as implication that a misleading
    error is returning with a negative length (not exploitable).
    
    Use IV from record for CBC mode, previously it decrypted the first block
    incorrectly and then threw this "decrypted" IV away. Now it extracts the
    IV and uses this for decrypting the first fragment block. (remember that
    CBC xor's the output of the block cipher with the previous ciphertext
    (or IV for the first block)).
    
    This is a preparation for GCM which does not have a MAC. The skip_mac
    branch is necessary to make the compiler happy in this patch, 'mac'
    could otherwise be uninitialised.

    From Peter Wu via https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9144 [PATCH] Update TLS Ciphers
    
    Correct cipher suites list, add TLS_ annotations
    
    Add official TLS_ names as comment and correct:
    - 6: RC2 is a block cipher using MD5, not stream+SHA.
    - 25,26,27: should be SHA instead of MD5
    - 98: DES export is a block cipher using 56-bits[1], not stream.
    - 99: DES export should be using 56-bits[1].
    - 138: removed commented RC4 cipher because it is not a block cipher
    
    Besides these comments and corrections, there are no further changes.

Author: Alexis La Goutte <alexis.lagoutte@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 19 20:26:50 2013 +0000

    From Peter Wu via https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9144 [PATCH] Update TLS Ciphers
    
    Drop export_cipher and dig_len, cleaner digest access
    
    Removed dig_len as this magic number is dependent on dig. The digests
    variable is converted from a string to a structure holding the digest
    name and length because of its close dependency.
    
    Introduce another struct+function to get rid of the magic number 0x40
    (DIG_MD5).
    
    Removed export_cipher bit as this is dependent on eff_bits < bits.
    Verified with:
    grep ,KEX_ packet-ssl-utils.c | awk -F, '{bits=$6!=$7;ex=$9;
    if ((bits && !ex) || (!bits && ex))print $6, $7, $8, "###", $0}'.
    
    Removed space before SIG_RSA for cipher 51 for consistency with others.

    the tvb_memcpy on the next line should be taking more data, but I don't know

Author: Gilbert Ramirez <gram@alumni.rice.edu>
Date:   Wed Sep 18 05:07:46 2013 +0000

    Update dfilter-test.py to use a much more modern test harness,
    the "unittest" module that comes with Python. Specifically, this
    takes advantage of a couple of features in the "unittest" in
    Python 2.7. The tests are all the same as before, but much
    better managed.
    
    This is in preparation for some work on the display filter code.

commit fb83410
Author: Jörg Mayer <jmayer@loplof.de>
Date:   Tue Sep 17 18:02:25 2013 +0000

    When building packet-dap.c on an empty build tree, packet-dap.c would
    be incorrect on the first pass and only be correct when remade.
    The reason was that disp-exp.cnf was created incorrectly on first pass.
    disp-exp.cnf required dop-exp.cnf to build correctly, so add a mechanism
    to add dependencies for export files.
    
    Note: Only the cmake change has been tested, the autofoo stuff requires
      testing.

    Convert proto_tree_add_uint_format to proto_tree_add_uint_format_value if hf_ field name is the first part of the formatted string.  This was all manual inspection and most cases were either:
    1. Case sensitivity differences between hf_ field name and formatted string.
    2. Unnecessary whitespace between hf_ field name and colon in formatted string
    
    There are cases where the hf_ field name doesn't quite match the proto_tree_add_uint_format, but it's close enough that one of them should be "right", I'm just not sure which is, I just know the string in proto_tree_add_uint_format is the one displayed.

    Sorry Anders, this may or may not cancel out some of the performance gain you
    were looking for. Either way, the new hash function is still an improvement.
    
    Fixes bidirectional conversation lookup, which was conveniently showing up as
    a DTLS decryption failure in the test suite. Go figure.

    Using memcpy on overlapping memory has undefined behaviour (read: on GCC 4.8.1 this destroys the plaintext and invalidates the MAC).
    
    This patch fixes parsing Application Data records for TLS 1.1 and 1.2 (while I am at it, also for DTLS 1.0/1.2) by using memmove instead of memcpy.

Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Sun Sep 15 01:48:30 2013 +0000

    Convert proto_tree_add_uint_format to proto_tree_add_uint_format_value if hf_ field name is the first part of the formatted string.  This was done with a perl script on the dissectors directory (packet-*.c), followed by manual inspection of the output.  The manual inspection yielded a few cases that really should have been proto_tree_add_uint or proto_tree_add_item, so I updated them accordingly.
    
    The script didn't catch as many as I would have liked, but it's a start.
    
    The most common (ab)use of proto_tree_add_uint_format was for appending strings to CRC/checksum values to note good or bad CRC/checksum.

    _lookup_extended takes a pointer to the key-pointer since it has to set the old
    key pointer value. _insert just takes the key-pointer, not a pointer to it.
    Passing a pointer-to-a-pointer causes the outer pointer to be dereferenced as a
    struct (when it in fact points to a pointer to struct) and leads to incorrect
    behaviour and uninitialized/out-of-bounds memory accesses.

Date:   Tue Sep 10 06:06:55 2013 +0000

    Freom Dennis:
    
    As I looked into the implementation in epan/dissectors/packet-ieee802a.c, there's a bug in the dissect_ieee802a(). After OUI and PID is parsed, it looks for the customized sub-dissector_table by
    oui_info = (oui_info_t *)g_hash_table_lookup(oui_info_table, GUINT_TO_POINTER(oui))
    The problem is that the oui is defined as an array (guint8 oui[3]), whose value contains the 3-byte customized OUI. However, here GUINT_TO_POINTER(oui) converts the local array oui's address to the hash table key, instead of the value. That cause the search in the hash table to fail, because the ieee802_add_oui() use the OUI value as the key.

Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 10 01:08:07 2013 +0000

    Restart the splash timer *after* the paint has completed, so that in situations
    when the paint takes a long time (for very large windows, or on older machines)
    that doesn't cause every single event to paint (which slows the whole thing to
    a crawl). Drop the splash timer to 15ms, since we're no longer counting paints
    this seems like a more appropriate value. The old value of 50ms would causing
    the splash to only paint once or twice during startup.

commit 51ccb61
Author: Chris Maynard <Christopher.Maynard@GTECH.COM>
Date:   Mon Sep 9 19:39:45 2013 +0000

    Fix the "crossed chopping region" problem.  Also, move chopping to its own function for both clarity and correctness since we need to compute chop offsets and lengths on a per-packet basis whereas previously this was not being done.
    
    Lastly, try to improve the documentation a bit concerning chopping and provide another example depicting 2 separate chopping regions.  *Maybe* this is clearer?
    
    One more example here for posterity:  Given the following 75 byte packet, there
    are 8 different ways to chop the 2 regions marked as 10 and 20 in a single pass:
    
        <--------------------------- 75 ---------------------------->
    
        +---+-------+-----------+---------------+-------------------+

    (A fix for crossed chopping regions should be coming in the near future ...)

    Added DissectorTable_set and DissectorTable_remove_all to simplify changing

    Now we only need this code in Lua plugins having port numbers prefs:
    
    PROTO.prefs.ports = Pref.range ("Ports", 0, "Port numbers", 65535)
    
    PROTO.prefs_changed()
      local udp_table = DissectorTable.get ("udp.port")
      udp_table:set (PROTO.prefs.ports, PROTO)

    OK, allow either positive or negative offsets no matter if we're chopping from the beginning or the end.
    
    Given the following example, it's now possible to chop the 10 bytes depicted from the 100 byte packet 4 different ways and achieve the exact same results:
    
        <-------- 100 -------->       Methods:
                                      1) editcap -C 20:10 in.pcap out.pcap
        +------+----+---------+       2) editcap -C -80:10 in.pcap out.pcap
        |  20  | 10 |   70    |       3) editcap -C -70:-10 in.pcap out.pcap
        +------+----+---------+       4) editcap -C 30:-10 in.pcap out.pcap

commit 1b009df
Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Sun Sep 8 19:32:10 2013 +0000

    Couldn't quite figure out how to make the expert items in proto.c and the LUA API filterable (suggestions welcome!), but I wanted to start forcing dissectors to use the filterable expert API (nothing like compile errors to force change!).  I created expert_add_info_format_internal (original expert_add_info_format) and used it as a placeholder for proto.c/LUA API until a solution is created.  The "new" expert_add_info_format will be the "old" expert_add_info_format_text, and I'll slowly do the search/replace.
    
    For those with dissectors outside the source tree, please see tools/convert_expert_add_info_format.pl for help with the conversion.  Please do not use expert_add_info_format_internal, as it's support time will be very short lived.

commit 15f1dd9
Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Sun Sep 8 18:35:36 2013 +0000

    Convert malformed ("protocol") expert infos into something filterable.  Not sure if "malformed.expert" is more confusing than helpful, but I didn't want it to share with the "malformed" display filter because their underlying types are different (FT_PROTOCOL vs FT_NONE).  The ".expert" has been my convention when a condition already has a well-named hf_ display filter, but also has expert info associated with it.
    
    Also removed the commented out calls to expert_add_info_format to avoid confusion, but left the comments noting the reason it's absent.

    NOTE: Some of the expert group values may need to be checked, PI_UNDECODED doesn't always seem like the right choice.  I thought PI_PROTOCOL should be used more.
    
    
    This concludes the conversion expert_add_info_format for all dissectors (where the function isn't commented or #defined out).  Onto the "internal" (epan/lua) uses of the call.

    The length field is retrieved from the packet in bytes, not bits, so stop
    adjusting it by 8 everywhere.
    
    Seems to fix https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9087 though
    someone more familiar with the protocol will have to verify it's actually
    correct now.

Author: Anders Broman <anders.broman@ericsson.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 5 05:34:40 2013 +0000

    From Chris Bontje:
    Changes include:
    - Detect previously-unknown object types.  No dissection is attempted of response messages, but at least the types are documented and labelled.  As Graham notes, if some examples are provided we can attempt a little more here.
    - Change up info_column object label handling to add some of the new objects.  Also added in a few that would be present in 'write' messages.
    - Add expert info field for abnormal IIN bits.  This will help me in my job of detecting unknown objects and unsupported function codes and will easily flag to the user that 'something is up' due to the color changes.
    - Only detect Application Layer if we are on the Final Transport Layer frame.

    Throughput graph updates.
    
    GTK+: Fix what appears to be an off-by-one error in the MA period (21
    segments instead of 20). Throw away our initial segment length instead
    of subtracting it from the moving sum, which skews the sum.
    
    Qt: Add the througput graph. Use bits/s for the throughput y axis. Let
    the user switch between graph types. The dialog hangs when doing this. I
    haven't been able to track down the cause. Remove some unused code.
    
    Both: Tell the user that we're using a 20 segment moving average. Move
    more routines to tap-tcp-stream.[ch].

    Correctly update the pane layout whenever the preferences are changed, you no
    longer need to restart for that to take effect. Hopefully I got all the slot
    ordering right.

commit 78529b2
Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 3 12:53:32 2013 +0000

    Separate window creation from the laying out of the list/tree/byte panes. This
    more-or-less restores the correct splash behaviour on startup.

commit 16cbf7d
Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 3 12:21:14 2013 +0000

    Parent the list, tree and byte panes from the main UI rather than the
    splitters they're actually layed out in. This should let us reorganize the
    splitters at will (when the prefs change) without reconstructing the panes.

commit 785c1a5
Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Sep 2 16:03:13 2013 +0000

    Respect the layout preference (just the horizontal/vertical splitting of the
    panes, not yet which data goes in which pane).
    
    You currently have to restart for the change to take effect. I also had to move
    the preferences-reading (and thus the epan_init) call to before the main window
    instantiation so that the preference was actually available for use. This means
    that the progress-bar doesn't show up for very long any more, since most of the
    work is already done by the time it appears.
    
    I'm sure there is a way to delay just the layout setup until later, but I kept
    getting slot errors I couldn't figure out...

Date:   Sun Sep 1 13:37:38 2013 +0000

    Send all alloc and free calls within wmem through wmem_alloc and wmem_free with
    a NULL allocator. This gives us a single, central place to handle out-of-memory
    errors (by, for example, throwing an exception) for basically all of epan.
    
    The only remaining glib memory that is directly allocated is for the hash tables
    used by the simple and strict allocators.

commit 1d27c70
Author: Gerald Combs <gerald@wireshark.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 30 21:15:24 2013 +0000

    Add an item tracer to the TCP stream graph. Enable packet selection.
    
    QCustomPlot data sets are made up of keys (x axis by default) and values
    (y axis). It looks like we can have multiple values for a given key
    (i.e. we can show multiple sequence numbers for a given timestamp) but
    QCPItemTracers can only be positioned by a key and not a key+value pair.
    This makes our graph selection behavior a bit different compared to the
    GTK+ version. We can only select one segment for a give timestamp but
    our selection targets are much larger (the height of the graph).
    
    Add a map for segment data so we don't have to iterate to find them. Use
    UTF8_RIGHTWARDS_ARROW where appropriate. Set a window title. Tell the
    user what will happen if he or she clicks. Disable graph selection.

    Since this commit the IP (source and destination) address in the GUI will be
    replaced with some date after I click on the entry, reverting this commit fixes
    the problem.
    
    
    This looks like a memory corruption. I imported an older pcap file.

commit bc65487
Author: Chris Maynard <Christopher.Maynard@GTECH.COM>
Date:   Thu Aug 29 18:15:13 2013 +0000

    Handle the 2GiB boundary case of the max filesize autostop condition properly so that we avoid overflow conditions and so that we ensure we don't capture more than 2GiB.  Also, document the max filesize autostop value of 2GIB as well as indicating that it's truly GiB and not GB.
    
    This fixes the problem reported on ask: http://ask.wireshark.org/questions/23891/wireshark-wont-run-with-multiple-capture-files

commit 5c85185
Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Aug 28 00:56:19 2013 +0000

    Fully deprecate read filter (-R) without two-pass (-2). It does exactly the same
    thing as the display filter (-Y) in that case except with more confusing
    semantics.
    
    This also lets us fix -c in the single-pass case to unconditionally count
    packets. This isn't the old behaviour (which counted them only if they passed
    the read filter) but is more consistent with two-pass mode where they are
    counted even if they pass the display filter, since they are counted on the
    first pass and the display filter is applied on the second pass.
    
    Anyone who wants to use -c to limit packet count conditionally on them passing a
    filter should use it in tandem with -2 and -R: the read filter is applied on the
    first pass before the count.

    Add initial mouse and keyboard controls. QCustomPlot uses different
    mouse interactions than the GTK+ version, but they seem to match modern
    UI conventions better. The keyboard shortcuts have been changed to match
    modern UI conventions as well, but I'll try to support the old shortcuts
    as much as possible.

    Have a separate list of extension sets to use in the Open dialog;
    include only extensions used mostly by capture files (i.e., not ".txt"
    or ".xml"), and list each extension set only once (it's silly to have,
    for example, separate entries for NetMon, Shomiti Surveyor, and
    NetScaler with ".cap" when you get all those types no matter which entry
    you choose).

commit df309c6
Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Sat Aug 24 01:42:43 2013 +0000

    Tool to help convert current expert_add_info_format() calls into filterable expert info API.  It's not as helpful as convert_proto_tree_add_text.pl because the expert string is usually too long to take the ei_ variable name or display filter string as is, but it does do the batch "search and replace" nicely and makes finding common expert info easier.

Date:   Sat Aug 24 01:38:43 2013 +0000

    If the proto_tree_add_text string is just "%s", assume it won't be converted (it's usually a header that has the same field filterable in its subtree)

commit 6614f28
Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Sat Aug 24 01:25:14 2013 +0000

    From Simon Zhong: Convert several proto_tree_add_text into filterable expert info.
    
    From me: Make "Reserved" fields filterable.  This was enough to pacify checkAPIs.pl, but part of the reason it was complaining in the first place is that many hf items are passed into info_to_display, which will end up calling a proto_tree_add_xxx function, rather than calling a proto_tree_add_xxx function directly.  Cursory glance says info_to_display could probably just be replaced with direct proto_tree_add_xxx calls.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Fri Aug 23 00:06:26 2013 +0000

    For the Windows Open dialog for capture files, get rid of the "(*.*)" in
    the "All Files" entry (the current UI guidelines from Microsoft say to
    do so, and that's what Paint does, at least), and add an "All Capture
    Files" entry with all the file extensions for the file types we support
    (it'll pick up all text files, but there's not much we can do about
    that, and it won't pick up files with *no* extension or weird
    extensions, such as you might get from UN*X systems or from WinDump
    commands, but at least it'll filter out some other crud).
    
    Fix what appear to be memory leaks; that should be backported unless
    I've missed something and they aren't leaks.

    Arrange that "make distcheck" use the GUI configure flags used to

    Wireshark was configured with --with-gtk2.  (This also means that if
    we're configuring only with Qt, or with GTK+ *and* Qt, "make distcheck"
    will check with those.)

commit d0722af
Author: Chris Maynard <Christopher.Maynard@GTECH.COM>
Date:   Mon Aug 19 21:41:49 2013 +0000

    When using relative sequence numbers, don't scale acknowledgment numbers unless the ACK bit is actually set; otherwise doing so results in many erroneous packets matching a filter such as, "(tcp.ack > 0) && (tcp.flags.ack == 0)".  With this change, the number of expert infos noting non-zero acknowledgment numbers when the ACK bit is not set is the same as the number of packets that are displayed when applying the above display filter regardless of whether using relative or absolute sequence numbers.  (Tested using the menagerie's mond.pcap file)

commit e20e338
Author: Chris Maynard <Christopher.Maynard@GTECH.COM>
Date:   Mon Aug 19 21:17:04 2013 +0000

    Someone is bound to miss these expert info items, so add back expert info items for ack and urgent pointer when their respective flags are not set; however, don't indicate "Broken TCP" and only add them as Notes rather than as Warnings as was previously the case prior to r51356 since nowhere does it indicate these fields must be zero when their respective bits aren't set.
    
    Speaking of r51356, a clarification to its commit message is in order: Initially my intention was to only add the urgent pointer field when the URG bit was set; however, I then noticed that the acknowledgment number field was always being added irrespective of the ACK bit.  Had I made the change as I originally intended, it would have introduced an inconsistency.  After some deliberation, I opted for consistency, but botched the commit message.

    Various fixes for dissection bugs from bug 9045 (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9045)
    
     - Expert info for CRC 0x5935 got wrongly attached to Slim SSDO packages
     - SPDO Data Requests that fit in the last bytes of a frame got missed
     - Slim SSDOs got detected, that actually are not Slim SSDOs, to prevent this in the future, two checks have been added
        - The reported length of a Slim SSDO must be larger than 0 (correct
          Slim SSDOs always have at least 1 byte)
        - Both crc's must differ from another. There is a very unlikely
          possibility, that they may collide, but in such a case openSAFETY
          in itself would be flawed by design.

Date:   Thu Aug 15 03:05:51 2013 +0000

    A few more improvements:
    1. Make a "dissect_dictionary" function for the common dissection of the different primary header versions.
    2. Remove some of the "dissection aborts" if sdnv values are bad.  Detecting malformed packets can be a good thing.
    3. Make fields that use a sdnv value filterable, with expert info if the value is bad.

Author: Chris Maynard <Christopher.Maynard@GTECH.COM>
Date:   Wed Aug 14 18:35:36 2013 +0000

    Nowhere in the RFC's (793 or otherwise) does it indicate that if the URG bit is not set that the urgent pointer field must be zero.
    
    References:
    http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793, http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122, ...
    http://www.wireshark.org/lists/ethereal-dev/200307/msg00297.html
    
    Similarly, nowhere does it say that the acknowledgment number field must be zero if the ACK bit is not set.
    
    This patch effectively reverts r37721.  If non-zero urgent pointers are of interest to you when the URG bit is not set, then a filter such as follows can be used:
    
        (tcp.flags.urg == 0) && !(tcp[18:2] == 00:00)
    
    Similarly, if non-zero acknowledgment numbers are of interest to you when the ACK bit is not set, then use this filter:
    
        (tcp.flags.ack == 0) && !(tcp.ack == 0)
    
    For consistency, should we avoid adding the ack field in this case as well?  The above filter would then change to:
    
        (tcp.flags.ack == 0) && !(tcp[8:4] == 00:00:00:00)
    
    This change was prompted by the following question on ask.wireshark.org:
    http://ask.wireshark.org/questions/23753/tcp-urgent-pointer-value-not-displayed

Date:   Tue Aug 13 11:37:27 2013 +0000

    Some improvements to the bundle protocol:
    1. Cleanly break out Convergence Layer Protocol (TCPCL) into its own (new-style) pure dissector.
    2. Make Bundle dissection into a new style dissector and clean so that it can be called using call_disssector.
    3. Use tcp_dissect_pdus for TCPCL protocol instead of "manual" while loop.  This allows contact header to benefit from TCP fragmentation.
    4. Make time fields use time field types so they can be filterable.
    5. A few functions were move to remove need for static declaration at top of file.
    6. Remove pri_hdr_procflags global variable.
    
    Next up - making more fields filterable.

    From Javier Godoy:
    Dissect additional OSD-2 service actions (CREATE/REMOVE PARTITION, GET/SET ATTRIBUTES, QUERY).
    
    This patch adds support for some OSD-2 service actions, following the approach described in bug 8832.
    
    The implemented service actions are:
     - CREATE PARTITION
     - REMOVE PARTITION
     - REMOVE COLLECTION
     - GET ATTRIBUTES
     - SET ATTRIBUTES
     - QUERY
    
    The following service action codes was #defined
     - OSD_2_REMOVE_PARTITION	0x888c
    
    The following trees were added
     - ett_osd2_query_criteria_entry
    
    The following fields were added:
     - hf_scsi_osd2_remove_scope (REMOVE PARTITION)
     - hf_scsi_osd2_immed_tr (QUERY)
     - hf_scsi_osd2_matches_collection_object_id (QUERY)
     - hf_scsi_osd2_query_type (query list CDB continuation descriptor)
     - hf_scsi_osd2_query_entry_length (query list CDB continuation descriptor)
     - hf_scsi_osd2_query_attributes_page (query list CDB continuation descriptor)
     - hf_scsi_osd2_query_attribute_number (query list CDB continuation descriptor)
     - hf_scsi_osd2_query_minimum_attribute_value_length (query list CDB continuation descriptor)*
     - hf_scsi_osd2_query_maximum_attribute_value_length (query list CDB continuation descriptor)*
     * (dissection of the attribute value in query descriptors is not implemented yet)
    
    The following value_string arrays were added:
     - scsi_osd2_remove_scope_val (OSD2r4 Table 143)
     - scsi_osd2_query_type_vals (OSD2r4 Table 75)
    
    The following value_string arrays were updated:
     - scsi_osd_svcaction_vals
     - scsi_osd2_object_descriptor_format_val
    
    The following functions were added:
     - dissect_osd2_query
     - dissect_osd2_query_list_descriptor (dissect CDB continuation descriptor type 0x0002)
    
    The following expert_info fields were added:
     - ei_osd2_query_values_equal (PI_PROTOCOL,PI_NOTE) - the minimum and maximum attribute values are equal in a query descriptor entry
    
    Changes in dissect_osd2_cdb_continuation:
     - Dissect case 0x0002
    
    Changes in dissect_osd_*
     - Initialize extra_data->osd2
     - Dissect OSD-2 specific fields
     - Call dissect_osd_cdb_continuation_length / dissect_osd_cdb_continuation  (if osd2)
     - Version-specific increment of offset after dissecting capability/security_parameters

commit 95785b9
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Aug 12 17:16:08 2013 +0000

    Use "command -v", required by recent POSIX, rather than "which"; I seem
    to remember this being suggested relatively recently on some mailing list
    (either one of the Wireshark lists or tcpdump-workers, I think).
    
    Handle systems where /usr/X11R6/bin is a symlink to /usr/bin and where
    the user running autogen.sh has /usr/X11R6/bin before /usr/bin in their

commit 70523b5
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Aug 12 09:09:32 2013 +0000

    On some platforms, to get dladdr() you need to link with -ldl.  First
    try it without -ldl (in case the OS doesn't have it - not a good idea,
    as it complicates the build process for cross-platform tools that might
    require it on other platforms, but "not a good idea" never stopped UN*X
    vendors in the past) and, if that fails, try it with -ldl.

commit f568d56
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Aug 12 08:28:34 2013 +0000

    Add in a bunch of UNIX-platform-specific ways of getting executable path
    information supplied by the kernel; sadly, we can't trust dladdr() to
    use those mechanisms, so we try this first.

commit 237c5a7
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Aug 12 00:59:34 2013 +0000

    If we weren't started with special privileges, try to figure out if
    we're running from inside an OS X app bundle and, if we are, save the
    pathname of the top-level bundle directory and use it to get the
    pathnames of global data files, plugins, and Python modules.
    
    This obviates the need to set special environment variables for them in
    the launcher scripts, so get rid of the commands to do that.
    
    The @rpathification of binaries also obviates the need for the
    commented-out setting of DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, so get rid of that as well.

Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>

    Split jumbo_free and jumbo_realloc into their own functions for readability and
    consistency (they are called just once and will be inlined by any reasonable
    compiler).
    
    Also add some comments, fix some spacing etc. No functional changes.

commit 959ee8f
Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Aug 11 16:06:07 2013 +0000

    Instead of using a glib slist to track the list of blocks, embed a short
    doubly-linked list at the head of each block. This was intended as a step
    towards supporting allocations bigger than the usual block size, but also shows
    up as a 2% performance improvement in the speed test, so win-win.

    Modelines and consistent indentation.
    
    Also tweak some ifdefs of function signatures. The multiple braces were

commit 84239c0

Date:   Sat Aug 10 21:34:15 2013 +0000

    Initialize float variables with float constants, not double constants,
    and assign float constants, not double constants, to float variables.
    Floating-point constants are double by default; you have to add "f" to
    the end to make them float.
    
    This squelches 64-bit-to-32-bit warnings.

Date:   Sat Aug 10 20:57:46 2013 +0000

    IxVeriwave 11ac patch (bug 8912) from Tom Cook.
    
    This was the 4th patch, but also:
    - use gmalloc0() to allocate vwr struct.  Otherwise, valgrind says that
      many of fields were still uninitialised when parse_s1_W_stats later
    read them
    - whitespace tidyup, got rid of remaining tabs and trailing whitespace
    
    Did a fair bit of fuzz-testing without seeing any problems.

commit 5c0baee
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Fri Aug 9 00:24:31 2013 +0000

    Don't print the packet counter when capturing if we're also printing
    packet information to a terminal (which we assume is the same terminal
    as the one to which the packet counts are being printed), as they get in
    the way of each other.
    
    Don't print it if we're sending the standard error to a terminal, or if
    -q is specified, either.
    
    Put all the setting of print_packet_counts together; it looks as if the
    default value of print_packet_counts may have been changed to TRUE and
    the code to handle -q wasn't changed to set it to FALSE if -q was
    specified rather than setting it to TRUE if it wasn't specified.

    When splitting a free chunk, if we don't have room for a free header don't even
    bother splitting. This greatly simplifies the logic, trims another 4% off the
    fast path, and doesn't actually affect the results at all because of the way we
    pad for alignment anyways.

    Speak of the "-d encap:" value as a linktype, rather than a DLT; if a
    name is specified, it currently must be a DLT_ name rather than a
    LINKTYPE_ name, as we use libpcap to do the mapping and it currently has
    no API to map LINKTYPE_ names to values, but if a number is specified,
    it could either be a LINKTYPE_ name or a DLT_ name if the two are
    different, and we want to encourage the use of LINKTYPE_ values.

Date:   Wed Aug 7 22:52:43 2013 +0000

    From Vaibhav Katkade via https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9011 :
    
    Add support for the Cisco MetaData (0x8909) ethertype.
    
    From me:
    
    Don't try to register the "eth.type" abbreviation; use "cmd.type" instead.
    Add SVN id.
    Clean up trailing white space and fix up some indentation.
    Don't declare a variable static that need not be.

commit c44883c
Author: Jeff Morriss <jeff.morriss.ws@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Aug 7 22:20:49 2013 +0000

    From Роман Донченко via https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9018 :
    
    This patch enables Wireshark to correctly decode messages specific to the
    selected key exchange method by determining and remembering that method.
    It's a little incomplete in that it doesn't support the case where
    first_kex_packet_follows is true, but then the current implementation
    doesn't either.
    
    It also adds/fixes dissection for the plain Diffie-Hellman key exchange and
    DH group exchange messages that were broken/missing, completing support for
    both of these key exchange methods.

Author: Jeff Morriss <jeff.morriss.ws@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Aug 7 16:46:08 2013 +0000

    Ensure we have both _initialize() and a corresponding _cleanup() routines for
    the various name resolvers; put those two routines next to each other.
    
    Add generic addr_resolv_init() and addr_resolv_cleanup() routines which call
    all of those internal routines.
    
    Call the generic init/cleanup routine from epan_init() and epan_cleanup().
    
    Create the hash tables for each name resolver in those initialization routines
    in order to avoid having to repeatedly check if the table is already created
    or not (and to avoid glib warnings if we neglected to perform that check):

commit 4317fad
Author: Anders Broman <anders.broman@ericsson.com>
Date:   Wed Aug 7 04:39:32 2013 +0000

    From Michael Mann:
    
    the heuristics of NDMP require 28 bytes to be present in order for it to be dissected as NDMP.  NDMP is purely a heuristic dissector because TCPENCAP shares the same TCP port.
    Since NDMP officially registered port 10000 with IANA, allow it to use dissector_add_uint() instead of packet-ipsec-tcp.c, and by default have TCPENCAP only rely on its heuristics.
