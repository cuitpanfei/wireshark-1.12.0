= Wireshark wireshark-version:[] Release Notes

== What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world's most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

== What's New

=== Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed:

//* ws-buglink:5000[]
//* ws-buglink:6000[Wireshark bug]
//* cve-idlink:2013-2486[]
//* Wireshark always manages to score tickets for Burning Man, Coachella, and SXSW while you end up working double shifts. (ws-buglink:0000[])

* "On-the-wire" packet lengths are limited to 65535 bytes. (ws-buglink:8808[], ws-buglink:9390[])
* "Follow TCP Stream" shows only the first HTTP request and response. (ws-buglink:9044[])
* Files with pcap-ng Simple Packet Blocks can't be read. (ws-buglink:9200[])
* MPLS-over-PPP isn't recognized. (ws-buglink:9492[])

=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new or have been significantly updated since version
1.10:

* The Windows installer now uninstalls the previous version of Wireshark
  silently.  You can still run the uninstaller manually beforehand if you wish
  to run it interactively.
* Expert information is now filterable when the new API is in use.
* The "Number" column shows related packets and protocol conversation spans
  (Qt only).
* When manipulating packets with editcap using the -C <choplen> and/or
  -s <snaplen> options, it is now possible to also adjust the original frame
  length using the -L option.
* You can now pass the -C <choplen> option to editcap multiple times, which
  allows you to chop bytes from the beginning of a packet as well as at the end
  of a packet in a single step.
* You can now specify an optional offset to the -C option for editcap, which
  allows you to start chopping from that offset instead of from the absolute
  packet beginning or end.
* "malformed" display filter has been renamed to "_ws.malformed".  A handful of
  other filters have been given the "_ws." prefix to note they are Wireshark
  application specific filters and not dissector filters.
* The Kerberos dissector has been replaced with an auto generated one from ASN1
  protocol description, changing a lot of filter names.  

Additionally the Windows installers have an extra component: a preview of the
upcoming user interface for Wireshark 2.0.

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 1.11.3:

* Transport name resolution is now disabled by default.
* Support has been added for all versions of the DCBx protocol.
* Cleanup of LLDP code, all dissected fields are now navigable.

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 1.11.2:

* Qt port:

** The About dialog has been added
** The Capture Interfaces dialog has been added.
** The Decode As dialog has been added. It managed to swallow up the
User Specified Decodes dialog as well.
** The Export PDU dialog has been added.
** Several SCTP dialogs have been added.
** The statistics tree (the backend for many Statistics and Telephony menu
items) dialog has been added.
** The I/O Graph dialog has been added.
** French translation has updated.

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 1.11.1:

* Mac OS X packaging has been improved.

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 1.11.0:

* Dissector output may be encoded as UTF-8. This includes TShark output.

* Qt port:

** The Follow Stream dialog now supports packet and TCP stream selection.
** A Flow Graph (sequence diagram) dialog has been added.
** The main window now respects geometry preferences.

=== Removed Dissectors

* The ASN1 plugin has been removed as it's deemed obsolete.
* The GNM dissector has been removed as it was never used.
* The Kerberos hand made dissector has been replaced by one generated from ASN1 code.

=== Platform Support

Support for Windows XP has been deprecated. We will make an effort to support it
for as long as possible but our ability to do so depends on upstream packages
and other factors beyond our control.

U3 packages are no longer supported or provided.

This is the last major release that will support 32-bit versions of Mac OS X.

=== Major API Changes

The libwireshark API has undergone some major changes:

* A more flexible, modular memory manager (wmem) has been added. It was
  available experimentally in 1.10 but is now mature and has mostly
  replaced the old emem API (which is deprecated).
* A new API for expert information has been added, replacing the old one.
* The tvbuff API has been cleaned up: tvb_length has been renamed to
  tvb_captured_length for clarity, and tvb_get_string and tvb_get_stringz
  have been deprecated in favour of tvb_get_string_enc and
  tvb_get_stringz_enc.
* dissector_try_heuristic() signature has been changed to return heur_dtbl_entry_t
  to make it possible to save it and use it in subsequent calls to avoid the overhead
  of going trough the heuristics list.

== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
http://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the http://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use Aboutâ†’Folders to find the default
locations on your system.
