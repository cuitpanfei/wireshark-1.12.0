What is Wireshark?

   Wireshark is the world's most popular network protocol
   analyzer. It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development
   and education.

What's New

  Bug Fixes

   The following bugs have been fixed:
     * "On-the-wire" packet lengths are limited to 65535 bytes.
       ([1]Bug 8808, [2]Bug 9390)
     * "Follow TCP Stream" shows only the first HTTP request and
       response. ([3]Bug 9044)
     * Files with pcap-ng Simple Packet Blocks can't be read.
       ([4]Bug 9200)
     * MPLS-over-PPP isn't recognized. ([5]Bug 9492)

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new or have been significantly
   updated since version 1.10:
     * The Windows installer now uninstalls the previous version
       of Wireshark silently. You can still run the uninstaller
       manually beforehand if you wish to run it interactively.
     * Expert information is now filterable when the new API is in
       use.
     * The "Number" column shows related packets and protocol
       conversation spans (Qt only).
     * When manipulating packets with editcap using the -C
       <choplen> and/or -s <snaplen> options, it is now possible
       to also adjust the original frame length using the -L
       option.
     * You can now pass the -C <choplen> option to editcap
       multiple times, which allows you to chop bytes from the
       beginning of a packet as well as at the end of a packet in
       a single step.
     * You can now specify an optional offset to the -C option for
       editcap, which allows you to start chopping from that
       offset instead of from the absolute packet beginning or
       end.
     * "malformed" display filter has been renamed to
       "_ws.malformed". A handful of other filters have been given
       the "_ws." prefix to note they are Wireshark application
       specific filters and not dissector filters.
     * The Kerberos dissector has been replaced with an auto
       generated one from ASN1 protocol description, changing a
       lot of filter names.

   Additionally the Windows installers have an extra component: a
   preview of the upcoming user interface for Wireshark 2.0.

   The following features are new (or have been significantly
   updated) since version 1.11.3:
     * Transport name resolution is now disabled by default.
     * Support has been added for all versions of the DCBx
       protocol.
     * Cleanup of LLDP code, all dissected fields are now
       navigable.

   The following features are new (or have been significantly
   updated) since version 1.11.2:
     * Qt port:
          + The About dialog has been added
          + The Capture Interfaces dialog has been added.
          + The Decode As dialog has been added. It managed to
            swallow up the User Specified Decodes dialog as well.
          + The Export PDU dialog has been added.
          + Several SCTP dialogs have been added.
          + The statistics tree (the backend for many Statistics
            and Telephony menu items) dialog has been added.
          + The I/O Graph dialog has been added.
          + French translation has updated.

   The following features are new (or have been significantly
   updated) since version 1.11.1:
     * Mac OS X packaging has been improved.

   The following features are new (or have been significantly
   updated) since version 1.11.0:
     * Dissector output may be encoded as UTF-8. This includes
       TShark output.
     * Qt port:
          + The Follow Stream dialog now supports packet and TCP
            stream selection.
          + A Flow Graph (sequence diagram) dialog has been added.
          + The main window now respects geometry preferences.

  Removed Dissectors

     * The ASN1 plugin has been removed as it's deemed obsolete.
     * The GNM dissector has been removed as it was never used.
     * The Kerberos hand made dissector has been replaced by one
       generated from ASN1 code.

  Platform Support

   Support for Windows XP has been deprecated. We will make an
   effort to support it for as long as possible but our ability to
   do so depends on upstream packages and other factors beyond our
   control.

   U3 packages are no longer supported or provided.

   This is the last major release that will support 32-bit
   versions of Mac OS X.

  Major API Changes

   The libwireshark API has undergone some major changes:
     * A more flexible, modular memory manager (wmem) has been
       added. It was available experimentally in 1.10 but is now
       mature and has mostly replaced the old emem API (which is
       deprecated).
     * A new API for expert information has been added, replacing
       the old one.
     * The tvbuff API has been cleaned up: tvb_length has been
       renamed to tvb_captured_length for clarity, and
       tvb_get_string and tvb_get_stringz have been deprecated in
       favour of tvb_get_string_enc and tvb_get_stringz_enc.
     * dissector_try_heuristic() signature has been changed to
       return heur_dtbl_entry_t to make it possible to save it and
       use it in subsequent calls to avoid the overhead of going
       trough the heuristics list.

Getting Wireshark

   Wireshark source code and installation packages are available
   from [6]http://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark
   packages. You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using
   the package management system specific to that platform. A list
   of third-party packages can be found on the [7]download page on
   the Wireshark web site.
     __________________________________________________________

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
   preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
   These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
   About->Folders to find the default locations on your system.
     __________________________________________________________
